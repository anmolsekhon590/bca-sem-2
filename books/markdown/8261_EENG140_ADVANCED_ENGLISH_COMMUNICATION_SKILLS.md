**Objectives**


After studying this unit, you will be able to:


 - Understand genres in a better manner

 - Know about its types and subtypes


**Introduction**

A _Genre_ refers to a kind of writing, and in academic writing usually refers to the arrangement of a
text to accomplish the goals of that text, e.g. how a cooking manual is arranged in steps rather than
in paragraphs. Despite the way many writing courses are taught, almost no texts conform to a
single genre or the expectations of any one genre. That said, genres can serve as a useful model for
how different texts are organized, and like any model, it is not universally or equally applicable to
all situations, but it helps readers using the model to better interpret the situation they find
themselves in.


**Importance**

_**The Impact of Genre on the Structure of Text**_

It is not necessary to define what all genres of text could be–these genres are rarely strictly followed
anyway. The important thing is that if one is reading an argument, description of a process, etc.,
there is likely to be a statement near the beginning which summarizes the authors’ main point, that
is, the thesis being argued, the process being explained, etc. If it is an argument, then it is likely that
each paragraph or section will relate to a premise for that argument. If it is a process being
described, then each paragraph or section will likely relate to some phase of that process. If a
comparison is being made, it is possible that each paragraph or section may be describing one or
the other thing being compared in alternation. Whatever the case, a critical reader should anticipate
the structure of the text accordingly, and you should be observant in order to understand how texts
are commonly structured in your field.

For modern texts, Shore (2016) advocated a bold strategy of starting with the conclusion, locating
the thesis, then using the foreshadowing of points in the introduction and the table of contents or


**Lovely Professional University** **1**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


section headers to locate important sections, and finally simply reading the important sections (pp.
8-39). That is an example of an aggressive strategy for understanding a text, and Shore (2016)
focused especially on reading books rather than short articles, but it is a powerful example of how
starting at the beginning and reading to the end is certainly not the only way and usually not the
best way to read an academic text.

Narratives may be unique, in that they are structured chronologically rather than according to the
author’s point. As a result, they may be the most difficult to locate relevant information within, as
the location of that information may be unpredictable. Caution must be applied. Narratives may be
less common in an academic setting than non-narratives; this is not because narratives are
categorically not useful, and they do appear in academic settings when they are useful. If they are
uncommon, it may be because they have a greater potential for diverse interpretations than some
non-narratives, and so may seem less suited to a clarity-oriented academic setting. When using
narratives in academic settings, an author should be careful to explain why the narrative is relevant
and make clear any distinctive interpretations of its meaning.


**Objective-**

**One Can Improve Your Vocabulary.**

When you read a wide array of books, it’s not uncommon to come across unfamiliar words and
phrases.

Sometimes you can glean enough context from the sentence to understand the meaning; other times
you’ll need to consult the dictionary for clarification.

Either way, you’re able to stow away the definition in your mind for later use.


Having a comprehensive vocabulary serves you well throughout your life.


        - It allows you to communicate more effectively with teachers and peers.

        - It improves your reading and writing skills.

        - It helps you process information faster.

        - It supports your efforts to stay informed of global affairs.


**You Can Develop A Broader Perspective.**

It isn’t just exposure to new words that can affect your view of the world…

When you mix things up and add a wide selection of titles to your reading list, you can start to see
people, places, and historical events in a new light.

For example, reading a nonfiction book about a group of people in another country can foster
greater understanding of cultures unlike your own.

Even a piece of fiction set in a different time period can allow you to see where we’ve been,

_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


narrative text contains good stories of fiction, non-fiction stories, animal stories(fable), folktales,
fairytales, myths, legends etc. .In simple words, everything about the story is included in narrative
text


**Purpose**

To amuse or to entertain the reader with a story

**Folklore**

Stories handed down through speech from generation to generation

**Fairy tale:** A story with magic monsters and/or talking animals (Like      - fiction, fantasy but part of

**Tall tale** : Stories set in Wild West, the main character’s strengths, skills or size have been
exaggerated and the tone is funny


**1.2** **Definition of Recount Text**

Literally, recount means to “To tell”. So Recount text can be interpreted as “Text that tells”. If we
refer to the information in school books, Recount text is the one that tells the reader about one story,
action or activity .Its goal is to entertain or inform the reader .But inside Recount text, there is no
complication just like Narrative text


**Generic Structure of Recount Text**

Orientation      - tells who was involved, what happened, where the event took place and when it
happened

Events – tell what happened in chronological sequence

Re-orientation – consists of optional-closure of events/ending


**Purpose of Recount Text**

Itis to list and describe past experiences by retelling events in the order in which it happened
.Recounts are written to retell events with the purpose of either informing or entertaining the
audience ( or both). In short, the pupose of recount text is to retell the past experience


**Language Feature of Recount Text**

Use the simple past tense, past continuous tense, past perfect tense and past perfect continuous
tense

        - Using temporal sequence e.g on Saturday, on Monday or on Tuesday

        - Focus on specific participant e.g I(The writer)

        - Use conjunctions such as Then,Before,after,etc

        - Use action verb(e.g went, stayed )


**1.3** **Examples of Recount Text**

**1.** **Travelling Around the World**


**4** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 01:Reading Texts of Different Genres and of Varying Length**_


Deri saved his money and spent two months traveling around the world. He wrote his journey in
his diary. I spent a week in New York and then flew to London and enjoyed several weeks in
Europe.When I had seen the sights in Europe, I took a train to Istanbul and visited many places in
Asia. First, I flew from his home in Mexico City to New York City. After through Asia, I went to
South America and finally back home to Indonesia.Deri felt tired but he was very excited and
wanted to travel again.


**Procedure text**

Procedure text is a text that explains or helps us how to make or use something. Its social function
is to describe how something is completely done through a sequence of steps. Communicative
purpose of this text is to describe how something is made through a sequence of actions or steps

Procedure text is a text that explains or helps us how to make or use something. Its social function
is to describe how something is completely done through a sequence of steps. Communicative
purpose of this text is to describe how something is made through a sequence of actions or steps.

There are three generic structures in procedure text. The first is goals or purposes. The second is
materials or tools. The third and the last are steps or methods. To know the text that we read is
procedure or not is so simple. You can read the title of it. If the title is started with ‘how to make…’
or ‘how to use…’ it can be certainly defined that the text is procedure text.


**1.4** **Generic Structure of Procedure Text**

# **Goal** : (e.g.: How to make spaghetti)

# **Material or Ingredient** : (e.g. : the material to cook omelette are egg, onion, vegetable oil, etc. )

# **Step** : (e.g.: first, wash the tomatoes, onion, …., second cut the onions becomes slice ….)


**Purpose of Procedure Text**

- To explain / tell (the reader) how to make / operate / do something through a sequence of
actions or steps.

- To explain steps / instruction to make / operate / do something


**Language Feature of Procedure Text**

- Use adverbial of sequence / Using temporal conjunction (e.g. : first, second, third, the last)

- Use command / imperative sentence (e.g. : put the noodles on the …., cut the onion …, wash the
tomatoes ….,)

- Using adverbials (Adverbs) to express detail the time, place, manner accurate, for example, for
five minutes, 2 hours, etc.

- Using action verbs, e.g. : make, take, boil, cook

- Using Simple Present Tense


**Explanation** **Texts** include specific features that include Written in the present

**Thanksgiving Day**


**Lovely Professional University** **7**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


Thanksgiving or Thanksgiving Day is a celebration of harvest, thankfulness for peace, and the
attempt of Native Americans. It is usually celebrated in late autumn.

In the past, Thanksgiving was celebrated for their rich harvest in New England. In North America,
however, it was originally held to thank God for their survival in the new land which was not easy
for them. However, in Canada, it had been celebrated as in New England. Thanksgiving now is
celebrated in United States of America and in Canada. Thanksgiving festivals are held every fourth
Thursday of November in the U.S and on the second Monday of October in Canada. It is usually
celebrated in four to five days in the North America and for three days in Canada.

It is celebrated through families and friends gathering to eat and give good luck. Turkey is the main
dish in the thanksgiving dinner. Thanksgiving parades are also usually held. In Thanksgiving
homes are decorated with wreaths, fresh and dried flowers. Lamps are lighted to brighten the
environment. Tables are decorated with best china and antique silver dishes to mark the occasion.

After studying this unit, the students will be able to

  - Understand longer pieces of discourse independently

  - Summarize the text for the benefit of peers orally or in writing

  - Evaluate and redraft a piece of writing

  - Illustrate and appreciate the social norms of communication

  - Interpret and re-narrate a piece of text either orally or in writing

  - Identify and overcome barriers of communication


**Introduction**

To understand the comprehension in a much better way and by consuming less time. It is indeed
also important to understand the passages with regards to the author’s Tone and indeed what
actually what author wants to convey from the passage. The heading or Title conveys a lot of
meaning. The Conclusion that is present in the last paragraph conveys the message given by the
writer or the author from the Comprehension . In order to understand the passage, one needs to
have a thorough understanding of the basic definitions involved with Comprehension like - > Facts
, Truth, Assumptions,inferences, Judgment, opinion, Argument and its types like Strong
Argument and Weak Argument . Also a Formula is there that becomes the backbone of
understanding the passage. It is

**FACTS + ASSUMPTIONS = CONCLUSION**

Before understanding this formula, one also needs to know Stated and Unstated Arguments. Stated
arguments are the ones that are written whereas unstated arguments are the ones that are hidden
and not stated in the passage which includes Assumptions, Inferences etc.

For understanding the passage in a proper and an effective way,one must have a through

While solving the questions, eliminate the options and arrive onto the correct answer


**2.1** **Tones of Reading Comprehension**

The tone that an author uses in a reading comprehension greatly influences what kind of story the
author tells and how the audience recognizes it.


**Narrative and Descriptive:**

In narrative reading comprehension – the author is the character himself and tries to convey a story
or an event. It usually answers the question- “Then what happened?”. A narrative type of RC often
present situations like a dispute, conflicts, problems & solutions, motivational events, etc. The basic
purpose is to gain a readers’ interest and thus, to engage the reader. Topics like the experience of
the first day at school or something that changed your life, etc.

In descriptive reading comprehension, the focus is to describe the character, a place, or an event in
detail. The author wants you to visualize whatever he sees, hears, smells, tastes, and feels.


**Jovial and Jocular/Humorous:**

When the author is humorous, he/she tries to make the context of the passage funny and amusing.
While being jovial, he/she is being happy, cheerful, and friendly.


**Sarcastic:**

It conveys a meaning that is exactly opposite to the actual meaning. This may be sometimes
confused with humorous, but often sarcasm is used for topics that the author is not much in favour
of. Try understanding the context of the passage, and identify if the usage of a sarcastic tone
justifies that.


**Critical and Cynical:**

**Critical tone** often describes a fault-finding attitude of the author; in a negative sense. It may also
indicate a deep analysis of an issue with an impartial outlook.

**The cynical tone** is when the author conveys a doubtful nature. He is pessimistic about whether
something will happen or whether it is worthwhile


**Nostalgic:**

Nostalgic tone conveys a sense of longing for the past. It can be good as well as a sad memory.

Example - I didn’t go to the moon, I went much further—for time is the longest distance between
two places.


**2.2** **Acerbic/harsh/severe/bitter/caustic/vitriolic**

How might you express your dissatisfaction for something or somebody brutally? Here comes the
part of the acerbic tone. The author uncovers his conflict with a hypothesis or may express his

_**Notes**_



_**Unit 02 :Different strategies of Reading Comprehension**_


despise towards a man in an acerbic tone. When you recognize this tone, you will have the capacity
to answer the questions that are asked in RC.


**Angry/indignant:**

Like the above type, this type of tone expresses the creator’s outrage towards the subject justifiably.
How would you justify your outrage towards any unfair system? You may do as such by a few
arguments, giving real examples and illustrations with respect to the subject. So also, the author
means to justify his outrage by expressing different reasons that are identified with the issue


**Apologetic:**

As the name expresses, this sort of tone is used to express regret or blame in regards to the setbacks
or tragedies that may have happened before. RC sections in light of this tone, by and large, discuss
opinions identified with world wars, natural disasters events or other such calamities that have
affected humankind adversely. Such sections may likewise incorporate a lot of statistical data
points.


**Belligerent/bellicose:**

This is when the author receives a belligerent tone of writing. RC passages in light of this sort of
tone effectively comprehend and let you effortlessly anticipate the responses to conclusion based
questions.


**Biased:**

While favoring a certain thing/person/group over the other, we tend to utilize a one-sided tone to
show our tendency towards it. Likewise, the author utilizes a one-sided tone and displays
contentions for a specific thing in that section. When you distinguish the author’s stand, you will be
able to make sense of the responses to the required question.


**Commiserating**

This kind of tone is used to express pain or show sensitivity for a man or a gathering of individuals
experiencing partial practices or social standards. The writer plans to familiarise the reader with the
trauma experienced by the sufferers


**Condescending/Patronizing**

A condescending tone suggests a mentality of patronizing superiority of a specific
thing/individual/gathering. As you would expect, such RC sections may show snobbish or
contemptuous tones with respect to things considered inferior in the author’s point of view.


**Cynical**

Do you have a tendency to talk about individuals you find doubtful? Here comes the part of the
skeptical tone. Sections are written in a negative tone uncover the writer’s perspective of society
being driven purely by self-interest.


**Dogmatic**

You should have some solid convictions and point of view with respect to specific parts of life. In
what sort of tone will you talk about them? This is the place one-sided tone becomes an integral
factor. At the point when the writer is self-assured with respect to his sentiments, he utilizes a
fanatical tone to pass on his perspective.


**14** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


**Euphemistic**

How would you express your despising or contradiction without being hostile or blunt? In such a
case, metaphorical tone acts as the hero. RC sections in this sort of tone make use of indirect and
implicit statements.


**Grandiose**

As the name suggests, this type of tone is adopted by RCs written in a descriptive or abstract style.
The passage may appear more elaborative than necessary. Also, sometimes abstract passages utilize
a grandiose style of writing.


**Introspective**

How would you talk about analyzing your feelings or contemplate your actions? Well, an
introspective tone is used in the passage so as to self-examine and reflect upon one’s actions and
feelings. You may find this as a common tone of reading comprehension in exams as well.


**Incendiary/ provocative**

You may have come across some famous speeches by great orators and found their words moving
or soul-blending. Well, that’s an incendiary tone into play. It’s the tone of speech which is also
utilized by revolutionaries and politicians. In other words, a provocative tone is intended to affect
individuals in a negative or positive course.


**Laudatory:**

How have you commended something or somebody you respected? That is the way that
commendatory tone sounds like. Regularly, descriptive passage accepts this sort of tone in order to
talk about a specific subject alongside specific justification.


**Pedestrian**

When a passage looks neither interesting nor complex to you, probably it has a pedestrian tone of
writing. In other words, this kind of tone is used when the RC passage talks about commonplace,
things, and ideas.


**Populist**

As the name says, a populist tone is used to discuss theories and characteristics exhibited by the
general populace. The author of the passage utilizes a populist tone to explain the features and
behavior of common people.


**2.3** **Sarcastic/satirical/ironical/taunting**

Try expressing your disliking indirectly and without sounding too serious? All things considered, a
lot of us have talked along these lines at one time or the other. At the point when the author
expresses a negative feeling about something in an insulting or unexpected way, he utilizes a snide
tone in the section.


**Speculative**

We do read about different articles in daily papers monetary, political, and so forth. Also, RC
sections throwing light any such hypotheses embrace a theoretical tone of composing. Putting in
different ways, such passages revolve around hypothetical things and expert opinions.

**2. Find keywords in Reading Questions**

In the process of scanning i.e. locating answer of the question, you will first need to read the
question carefully to find important keywords you can mark and at the same time, to understand
meaning of the question.

  - Keywords you underline are usually nouns, group of nouns, verbs etc. except articles (a,
an, the), prepositions (for, in, at etc.) and others.

  - An extremely important strategy of underlining keyword is to identify the focus of the
question, especially in MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions). Focus or stem of the question is
a word in the question that will help you to choose the right option. For example, focus or
stem is highlighted in the following question:

Sometimes, your keywords are synonyms or similar words, not the exact keyword as given in the
passage and hence, you can try to understand its meaning to relate it well with the right paragraph.
However, the nearby words and paraphrasing skill will help you understand the meaning of the
question.

**Objectives**


After studying this unit, you will be able to:

  - To understand non - linguistic texts

  - To interpret non - linguistic texts

  - To decode non - linguistic texts

  - Importance and its relevant usage


**Introduction**

In order to test if you really have the ability to read non-verbal language, a good exercise is to turn
on the television and watch a movie, novel, or series (that’s not subtitled), turn down the volume,
and try to work out what’s happening. One will be amazed to realize that the body can say as
much or even more than words. Indeed, with the movements of their hands or legs, expressions
on their face, or certain attitudes (such as scratching their head, pacing from side to side, or sitting
on the edge of a chair), people are speaking even though they aren’t really saying anything.


**Importance**

**The** **Non-linguistic aspects** the non-linguistic aspects are also no less important than the linguistic
aspects. Some of non-linguistic aspects are:

**1.Segment-levelchecks**

Sometimes translators, unknowingly, overlook translating sentences or paragraphs which result in
translation errors. Translators should always check for forgotten or incomplete translations to
procure perfect translation.

**2.Inconsistency**


**Lovely Professional University** **23**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


The translation must be consistent and meaningful. Inconsistency could occur in the source or
target languages, so translators have to make sure that the translation is consistent.

**3.Numbering**

Translators should always check the numbering values or formatting, measurement unit
conversion, or digit to text conversion to avoid making errors that are related to the points
mentioned above.

Translators should learn from the aforementioned points and always check and proof-read their
translations to produce an accurate, perfect product. “The importance of good translation is most
obvious when things go wrong,” (OKRENT,2016). Translators also should learn from their mistakes
and try not to make such mistakes in future assignments.


**Objective**

Nonlinguistic representations can be used to learn new vocabulary words, take notes, capture
information along a timeline, symbolize information that is difficult to see—such as parts of an
atom or solar systems—depict historical events, connect new learning to previously learning
information, and demonstrate understanding beyond linguistics. Nonlinguistic representations can
be used to learn new vocabulary words, take notes, capture information along a timeline, symbolize
information that is difficult to see—such as parts of an atom or solar systems—depict historical
events, connect new learning to previously learning information


**Importance**

Even though we are used to analyzing how words are used in a visual text, questions on nonlinguistic features are also commonly tested and are equally important in helping the text to better
achieve its purpose and reach out to its audience. I hope you have gained some useful knowledge.


**Definition**

A non-linguistic is an actual or possible derivation from a sentence, which is not associated with
signs that have any original or primary intent of the communication. It is a general term of art used
to capture a number of different senses of the word "meaning", independently from its linguistic
uses.


**Context / Non- Linguistic Visual Context**

Psycholinguistic research has shown that visual context can influence language processing through
referential and lexico-semantic links. We review these findings and discuss incremental visual
context effects on language comprehension that emerged even without these links and even when
the visual context was irrelevant for the comprehension task. The reviewed evidence suggests our
notion of non-linguistic visual context must be relatively broad and encompass language-world
relationships that go beyond reference or lexico-semantic associations .


**3.1** **Non-Linguistic Aspects**

The non-linguistic aspects are also no less important than the linguistic aspects.

_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


There are some crucial aspects that translators have to maintain in relation to translation
management and if translators do not take care of, their translation product will be affected
negatively. As a result, this would take out of their reputation as translation. These aspects are
divided into two main categories as follows:


**The linguistic aspects** **:**

The linguistic aspects      - as per SAE J2450 Translation Quality Metric Task Force      - which translators
should be aware of are:

**1.** **Wrong terms**

Translators should avoid using wrong terms, as far as possible, to produce good, accurate product.
Using wrong terms would change the intended meaning and lead to misunderstanding in the
target language. As a result, this may result in mistranslations which may cause problems. The
following example explains that: The word “asistir” doesn’t mean “to assist,” it means “to attend.”

**2. Syntactic errors**

A syntax error is a violation of the syntax, or grammatical rules. The following sentence contains an
error of English syntax: “I is going to visit my uncle.” Translators and linguists should not do such
mistakes in writing as they indicate that they are not professionals.

**3. Omission**

Omission could be useful in some few cases, but in most cases, it may lead to serious problems as in
this example: For a reason or another the “c” in President Barack Obama’s first name was omitted.
The mistake was spotted just a few days before the election, incurring approximately $75,000 in
reprinting costs, as (Katherine, 2016) stated.

**4. Misspelling**

Translators should check and proof-read their translation before submitting it to the client to ensure
that there free of misspelling because this will definitely affect the quality of translation negatively.
According to a July 2011 BBC News article, spelling mistakes cause readers to lose faith in the
quality of a website’s content, resulting in “millions … in lost revenue,” (Katherine, 2016).

**5. Punctuation mistakes**

Although many translators do not take care of using punctuation marks or use it incorrectly, it is
really important to use in writing in order to clarify the meaning. The following example is really
good to show the importance of punctuation and how the misuse of punctuation can cause
problems: “Una mujer sin su hombre no es nada.” -- When you read this sentence without using
punctuation marks, you will notice that it has three versions, or it could be understood in three
different ways as shown below:

           - A woman without her man is nothing.

           - A woman **,** without her **,** man is nothing.

           - A woman **,** without her man **,** is nothing .

Reading-while-listening may be especially well suited for young language learners because of the
multimodality provided in many graded readers aimed at this age group (ie., the presence of oral
and written text and illustrations). This study compares a group of students who were exposed to
18 sessions of reading-while-listening with a group exposed to the same number of sessions
through reading-only, and a control group. Linguistic outcomes show that students in the two
intervention groups obtained higher vocabulary gains than those in the control group but did not
present superior scores in reading or listening comprehension or reading fluency. Non-linguistic
outcomes showed a clear preference on the part of the students for the reading-while-listening
mode of input. The study concludes that the lack of differences in comprehension and fluency gains
may be due to the fact that graded readers for children are too short; the input they offer is too
limited to make a difference in areas other than attitudes and vocabulary learning.

Specifically, previous studies either did not use a control group (e.g., Oday, 2002;Taguchi et al.,
2012), or if they did, the students had the opportunity to read the texts several times (e.g., Blum et
al., 1995;Taguchi et al., 2004), thus making it unclear whether the positive results should be
attributed to the effect of audiobooks or to other uncontrolled factors, such as repeated exposure to
the texts. Moreover, this study targets ninth-grade K -11 participants, to whom the results from


**26** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 03: Reading and Interpreting Non-Linguistic Texts**_


younger learners (e.g., Blum et al., 1995;Koskinen et al., 2000;Mestres, Baro, & Garriga, 2019;Tragant
& Vallbona, 2018) or university students (e.g., Taguchi et al., 2004;Taguchi et al., 2012) may not be
applicable. Furthermore, due to the absence of any studies addressing the reading fluency and/or
motivation of Kazakhstani EFL learners using audiobooks, this study stands to contribute to
research on English Education in Kazakhstan.

Unlike the extensive research in L1 contexts, the use of audiobooks has not been investigated to any
great extent in L2 contexts. Nevertheless, a relatively small number of available studies in L2
context observed some benefits of using audiobooks in terms of vocabulary gains (e.g., Chang,
2011;Gobel & Kano, 2014;Mestres, et al., 2019), enhancement of listening fluency (Chang,
2011;Mohamed, 2018), comprehension and reading fluency improvement (e.g., Blum et al.,
1995;Chang, 2012;Chang & Millet, 2015;Gobel & Kano, 2014), and a positive attitude toward
reading and engagement with reading in English (e.g., Blum et al., 1995;Hickey, 1991;Koskinen et
al., 1999Koskinen et al.,, 2000Tragant & Vallbona, 2018). While these studies were conducted
within a classroom framework, some extended to include reading at home (in addition to classroom
reading) and shared reading practice (Blum et al., 1995;Koskinen et al., 1999Koskinen et al.,, 2000. ..
Despite growing agreement that the use of audiobooks leads to positive effects in reading abilities,
findings revealing mixed effects (i.e., a facilitative effect on some aspects and none on others) have
been reported as well. For instance, Mestres et al. (2019) observed a significant difference in
vocabulary gains, but none in reading fluency between students reading silently and those reading
and listening to the books at the same time. The researchers attributed such results to the relative
shortness of graded readers (909 words on average), and consequently to the limited overall input
received in the study.


**3.4 Importance of Reading** **Comprehension in Non-Linguistic** **Subject**

**Matter Learning**


**Importance of reading comprehension**


The person who does not read the right books has no advantage over the person who can't read at
all. Knowing how to read is very important for learning. Comprehension means the action of
understanding. Reading comprehension in non-linguistic subjects indicates the understanding of
what is being communicated and translated with the means of verbal and in some cases non-verbal
means, interpreting specific terms, signs, and conventions.


**3.5** **Linguistic And Non-Linguistic Aspects in Translation**

As language may not always be used to communicate, so also communication may be possible
without necessarily using spoken language. For example sign language. Deaf and dumb people
have their own non-linguistic code (gestures and hands signs) to express themselves or to
communicate with one another. The linguistic key is the tone, manner or spirit in which an act is
performed. Linguistic communication differs from non-linguistic communication. For
communicating linguistically, the whole language is available. Sometimes one can communicate in
even more than one language, whereas the choices are limited for a non-linguistic communicator,
such as, facial expressions, signs and gestures, movements of hands etc. An interesting point here is
that even linguistic communication is accompanied by certain elements of non-linguistic


**Lovely Professional University** **27**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


communication. While talking a speaker often uses facial expressions and hand movements to
convey his message with greater force or more elaborately. This also gives the listener an idea about
the speakers mood and attitude.


The linguistic oriented approach to translation finds the very essence of translation is in the basics
of the linguistic concept of translation, which is the fact that the process of translation is a language
act in which a text from one language is substituted with an equivalent text from another, by
making that substitution in accordance with the regulations of both language systems. This paper
will deal with translation related issues through contrastive analyses between Macedonian and
English, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. In the process of finding
translation equivalence, there are instances of finding absolute equivalence, partial and no
equivalence. This paper analyses such examples. In translating lexemes with no equivalent, which
are culture specific, translators find themselves in a difficult position.


**Linguistics**


Linguistics is the scientific study of language, and involves an analysis of language form, language
meaning, and language in context. The earliest activities in the documentation and description
of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE who wrote a formal description of
the Sanskrit
Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between sound and
meaning. Phonetics is the study of speech and non-speech sounds, and delves into their acoustic
and articulatory properties. The study of language meaning, on the other hand, deals with how
languages encode relations between entities, properties, and other aspects of the world to convey,
process, and assign meaning, as well as manage and resolve ambiguity. While the study
of semantics typically concerns itself with truth conditions, pragmatics deals with how situational
context influences the production of meaning.


**3.6** **The Role of Linguistic Factor in Translation**

The linguistic oriented approach to translation finds the very essence of translation is in the basics
of the linguistic concept of translation, which is the fact that the process of translation is a language
act in which a text from one language is substituted with an equivalent text from another, by
making that substitution in accordance with the regulations of both language systems. This paper
will deal with translation related issues through contrastive analyses between Macedonian and
English, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. In the process of finding
translation equivalence, there are instances of finding absolute equivalence, partial and no
equivalence. This paper analyses such examples. In translating lexemes with no equivalent, which
are culture specific, translators find themselves in a difficult position


**Non-linguistic**

A non-linguistic is an actual or possible derivation from sentence, which is not associated with
signs that have any original or primary intent of communication. It is a general term of art used to
capture a number of different senses of the word "meaning", independently from its linguistic uses.
We need to understand “What is a Context” by delineating “non-linguistic visual context” from a
language-processing perspective. Psycholinguistic research has shown that visual context can
influence language processing through referential and lexico-semantic links. We review these
findings, and discuss incremental visual context effects on language comprehension that emerged
even without these links and even when visual context was irrelevant for the comprehension task.
The reviewed evidence suggests our notion of non-linguistic visual context must be relatively broad
and encompass language-world relationships that go beyond reference or lexico-semantic
associations. At the same time, a strong utterance-mediated link seems necessary, predicting visual
context effects closely time-locked to relevant words in the utterance and to dynamic motion in
visual context.

**Quality standards**

There are a number of different quality standards that are applicable to the language services
industry. Not all of the ones that cover translation services will also apply to interpretation services,
as these tend to be assessed by separate quality standards. A separate quality certification standard


**28** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 03: Reading and Interpreting Non-Linguistic Texts**_


is also used for machine translation, even if the translated material is reviewed and edited by a
human.

In fact, the quality standard covering machine translation (ISO 18587) states that the person who
post-edits any machine translated material needs to have the equivalent qualification to a translator
covered by ISO 17100 quality standards. With machine translated material usually associated with
a lower standard of translation quality, insisting on this high level of qualification for a human
editor helps introduce some quality back into the process.


**Reading comprehension plays a crucial role in non-linguistic subject matter for the**
**following reasons-**

  - Reading comprehension encourages the learner to become active, constructive, and
potentially autonomous learning.

  - It helps to understand subject-specific vocabulary for learning a particular topic.

  - It provides sufficient scope for introspection and self-evaluation.

  - Reading comprehension develops curiosity to learn something.

  - It helps to understand subject-specific competence and discourse competence.

  - It helps to integrate new information in a non-linguistic context with existing knowledge.

  - It helps the students to learn to recognize specific terms, words, letters simply.

  - This skill opens the doors of opportunity in all directions, doors that will not be visible
normally unless you are a very good reader, writer, and communicator.

  - If one does not become proficient in this skill, one will find it very difficult to communicate
with others as well as find it difficult to communicate with oneself.

  - If one can't read at a decent level of comprehension, one will not have access to most of the
world's accumulated knowledge and information that are mostly in the text format.

  - The more quality words that one has in one's vocabulary and the more words that one can
comprehend, the more potential one will have and the more one will understand.

  - It helps to interpret difficult words and terms of non-linguistic subjects.


**3.7** **Tips for Engaging in Nonlinguistic Learning**

  - **Consistently** **use** **each** **type** **of** **nonlinguistic** **representation:** It’s important that

students learn several ways to represent information nonlinguistic ally. This means

providing students at every grade level with multiple opportunities to use kinesthetic

movement, draw pictures and pictographs, use their senses and emotions to form solid

mental images, be fluid in the use of several graphic organizers, and create or use physical

models to denote their learning. Consistent use is key; if you use these strategies only

occasionally, it will limit students’ ability to grasp the possibilities associated with learning

both linguistically and nonlinguistic ally, preventing them from developing automaticity in

their use of all the representations.


  - **Help students engage in conversations with peers to explain their choice and use**

**of** **a** **nonlinguistic** **representation:** When students engage in peer discourse to explain

why they chose a certain nonlinguistic representation for the content being studied, they

deepen their understanding of the content and are better able to make connections between

types of information. Peer conversations help students elaborate on their learning; they

describe their thinking and listen to others do the same, helping them extend and apply


**Lovely Professional University** **29**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


their learning. When students engage in peer and classroom conversations, it becomes easier

to expose and correct any confusion about or misinterpretations of the content. Using

sentence stems and guiding questions may also help students become more proficient in

speaking with, listening to, and understanding one another.

       - **Students can use multiple nonlinguistic representations to learn or represent a**
**concept:** It would be a mistake to believe that students should select only one nonlinguistic
strategy to represent a piece of content. Nothing could be further from the truth. When
students are encouraged to combine and use multiple nonlinguistics to represent their
learning, the probability of deeper understanding and longer retention increases. For
example, students learning the vocabulary word defenestrate, which means to throw
something out the window, might kinesthetically demonstrate the word, followed by
sketching what it looks like to defenestrate. Ultimately, students should be given time to
create a mental picture of how they look defenestrating an object.


       - **Students should be encouraged to use nonlinguistic representations on their**

**own:** Nonlinguistic representations can be used to learn new vocabulary words, take notes,

capture information along a timeline, symbolize information that is difficult to see—such as

parts of an atom or solar systems—depict historical events, connect new learning to

previously learning information, and demonstrate understanding beyond linguistics. When

students consistently represent their learning using a nonlinguistic approach, they

internalize useful methods and multiple ways to process and make sense of new

information. Ultimately, the goal is to create a desire in students to use these learning tools

without teacher insistence.


       - **Applying the tips to instruction:** As with the implementation of any instructional
strategy, teachers who wish to improve student learning need to intentionally plan for and
consistently use nonlinguistic representations in their lesson design and delivery. Setting a
purpose for using these important instructional strategies, along with a willingness to stay
the course in their application, will go a long way to establishing routine use for teachers
and the students they have the privilege of serving.


**Summary**

       - A non-linguistic is an actual or possible derivation from a sentence, which is not associated
with signs that have any original or primary intent of the communication

       - The non-linguistic aspects are also no less important than the linguistic aspects.

Some of the non-linguistic aspects are:

1. Segment-level checks

2. Inconsistency

3. Numbering

      - Reading comprehension plays a crucial role in non-linguistic subject matter

4.1 Suitable Approaches for Sentence Completion

Keywords

Self Assessment

Answers for Self Assessment

**Introduction**


 - Test the skill to use the information observed in complex and incomplete sentences in order to

correctly complete them.

 - It tests a candidate’s vocabulary power and skill to follow the logic of sentences.

 - These sentences are often quite complex.


**4.1** **Suitable Approaches for Sentence Completion**

Suitable Approaches for Sentence Completion:


 - A good vocabulary can be a great help for such sentence completion.

 - Although we can use many approaches for such type of questions, even without knowing all

the choices.

 - Some of them are as follows.

The hints given may indicate what should go into the blank for the meaningful sentence. Here’s a
test to locate the right hint. If we change the hint, then the choice in the blank must change. We can
check the hint by putting that word or phrase into the blank itself.

The __________ old woman was surprisingly __________ in conversation.


1. cruel . . . malicious

2. neurotic . . . fretful

3. desiccated . . . vivacious

4. decrepit . . . necrotic

5. affable . . . Convivial

**EXPLANATION:**

**HINT** : Word surprisingly indicates that opposite word are used.

“Desiccated” means _dried out_ and can be used to indicateextreme age or frailty, while “vivacious”
indicatesliveliness and energy. Since the second blank is precededby “surprisingly,” the two words
in the correct choicemust have dissimilar meanings.

3. Pluses and Minuses:

Once we find the word clues, indicate the kind of word we are now looking for with positive
meaning or negative meaning. Also, to indicate synonyms or antonyms, we can use these symbols.

The new restaurant received conflicted reviews: the food was __________ but the ambiance
was __________.


1. inedible . . . morose

2. acclaimed . . . sublime


**Lovely Professional University** **35**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


3. plausible . . . obsequious

4. exquisite . . . abominable

5. lauded . . . Discomfiting

**Explanation:**

It is important to remember who is doing these actionsthe critics would be completing the action so
the verb mustrelate to the process of critiquing a restaurant—thus only"acclaimed . . . sublime" or
"lauded . . . discomfiting" arerelevant. The sentence suggests that the conflict in the reviewswere
between the food and the ambiance, and thus "acclaimed …. sublime" would not fit, leaving only
"lauded . . . Discomfiting.


**3. Pluses and Minuses:**

Once we find the word clues, indicate the kind of word we are now looking for with positive
meaning or negative meaning. Also, to indicate synonyms or antonyms, we can use these symbols.

The new restaurant received conflicted reviews: the food was __________ but the ambiance
was __________.


1. inedible . . . morose

2. acclaimed . . . sublime

3. plausible . . . obsequious

4. exquisite . . . abominable

5. lauded . . . Discomfiting

**Explanation:**

It is important to remember who is doing these actionsthe critics would be completing the action so
the verb mustrelate to the process of critiquing a restaurant—thus only"acclaimed . . . sublime" or
"lauded . . . discomfiting" arerelevant. The sentence suggests that the conflict in the reviewswere
between the food and the ambiance, and thus "acclaimed ….sublime" would not fit, leaving only
"lauded . . . Discomfiting.

The Example are worked out in two steps:

Step 1: define the blanks.

Use context clues in the sentence to figure out what the words in the blanks will mean.

Step 2: match your answer.

Pick the answer that provides the word you need for both blanks.


      - You get **two chances to eliminate** each answer. Remember that both words have to match;

      - If even one is wrong, you can confidently eliminate the whole answer without even knowing

the other.

This makes two-blank sentence completions a lot more forgiving if your vocabulary isn't quite good
where you'd like it to be.

Learning is more efficient when it is ________. It is less efficient when it is ________.


A. fast … slow

B. rapid..turtle-slow

C. tedious…like a joy ride

D. fun…drudgery

**EXPLANATION:**

In the given case, we need a positive word in the firstblank. And on top of that, we need a word
that gets wellthe sentiment of effective learning. Speedy or rapidlearning may not necessarily be
efficient. Drudgerymeans hard monotonous routine work and is theopposite of fun learning.

Social studies, science matters of health and safety, the very atmosphere of the classroom; these
areas are few of the ________ for the ________ of proper emotional reactions.


1. things…growth

2. fertile areas…basis

3. fertile fields..inculcation

4. important areas…formation

**Explanation:**

What would we call social studies or matters of health andsafety? Things or areas? Obviously, these
are areas which areimportant. And secondly, they are important for the formation ofemotional
reactions. That is their purpose. The words fertile orthings are grossly incorrect in the given context.

Their relations were perhaps not extremely warm, but they were nevertheless __________. One
does not need to be __________ in order to be friendly.


1. honest . . . candid

2. considerate . . . joyous

3. acceptable . . . optimistic

4. staid . . . plebeian

5. amicable . . . effusive

**Explanation** : The key word in the second sentence is “friendly”, and this helps us to focus on the
distinct possibility of using “amicable” for the first blank. This word means _having a friendly spirit_,
or even more simply, _friendly_ . It is derived from the Latin words for “friend” and “friendship” and
is likewise reflected in the contracted form “amiable.”

“Effusive” means _to express positive affection in an abundant manner_ . It comes from the Latin prefix
“ex-“ (meaning _out of_, such as in “exit”) added to the word _fundere_, which has forms that replace the
“d” with an “s.” _Fundere_ means _to pour_, and with the “ex” (which becomes “ef” because it is easier
to pronounce), we get _to pour out_ . _Fundere_ has many derived English words such as “effusion,”
“profuse,” “foundry,” and “fuse.” These latter words are derived from the second sense of the
word _fundere_, meaning _to melt_ or _make by means of melting_ .

As the temperature **(A) _____** during the summer season, many households turn to air conditioners
to keep them cool. Air conditioners, which were once regarded as a residential luxury, have now
become a **(B) ___.** Enjoying a cooler atmosphere during hot weather is not the only benefit of using

**Introduction**

In order to analyses a topic for an essay or report, the first and the basic step is to identify the topic.
Once it is identified, then check, what are the basic points on which it has to be developed .Ensure
while writing it, its structure is maintained and it’s adequately followed. The content and language
used should be in such a manner that it is readable, understandable and can be easily interpreted.
Maintaining and using proper paragraphs are very helpful. Each paragraph has and carries a
specific meaning


**5.1** **How To Write Critical Analysis**

Have you ever read an article and thought to yourself: “I disagree with this writer; I think they are
biased”? Perhaps you’ve even gone as far as offering your own opinion in the comments section. If
you’ve done this, good job! You have performed a critical analysis; you’ve analyzed the author’s
work and offered your own opinion in response.

Writing a critical analysis requires lots of essential reading, as authors always use rhetorical
techniques to gain your trust. In this article from our essay writing service, we will define critical
analysis, list some topics and provide a critical analysis essay example to give you a better idea of
your expected result. We will also present a robust step-by-step process of how to write a critical
analysis.


**5.2** **What Is a Critical Analysis Essay?**

A critical analysis essay requires its writers to write a critical evaluation of an argument. Topics can
range from analyzing a modern or historical event, film, book, types of music, and complicated
social and political issues. It is a form of evaluation and observation with subjective elements.
Critical analysis helps one to better understand a subject and it allows one to examine different
controversial points of view.

The main purpose of a critical analysis essay is to tell a reader about a subject, and to explain its
purpose and meaning. You will also need to present your personal point of view and critically
analyze the subject.

Since critical analysis is very subjective, it is important to avoid some common mistakes. First and
foremost, keep your tone formal and academic. Stay away from familiarities and slang. Second,
critical analysis is mainly your own opinion on a matter that can be supported by the work of
others. Do not base your entire essay on works of other scholars. If you do use supporting evidence
from other sources, make sure that you reference it to avoid plagiarism. Next, make sure you focus
on the analysis of the subject, rather than on the description of it. In critical analysis essays the point
of interest is your opinion about the matter, not the matter itself. Lastly, make sure you follow a
good structure and make sure that you have enough sufficient evidence. Double-check the logical
sequence of your arguments to ensure that you present them to your reader correctly.


**5.3** **Two Simple Steps to Perform Critical Analysis**

**1) Critical Reading**

**2) Critical Writing**

It is very easy to confuse a descriptive essay with a critical analysis essay. A descriptive essay
simply states what the subject is, or when and how an event happened. On the other hand, a critical
analysis essay explains the significance of that subject and your personal viewpoint on the matter. It
digs deep into a subject and shows the complexity of it. Instead of simply describing, a critical
analysis essay evaluates the issue in different contexts and points of view. Reasoning and argument
are the best approaches to differentiate a critical analysis essay from a descriptive one.

Living in an era of social and political unrest certainly has its benefits. Students often pick
controversial statements, articles, or events, because they lend themselves easily to critical analysis.
Finding a topic for critical essay in this day and age shouldn’t be hard.


**Here are a few things to consider when deciding on a topic:**


  - Make sure the topic lends itself easily to critical analysis. Famous literature and

controversial articles would be excellent choices.

  - Find a topic which is widely discussed. Different opinions can help you think outside the

box and create a strong argument.

  - Try to keep it narrow. Some topics can be complicated, and it may take books to explore

them fully.

  - Talk to your professors for ideas. They will happily point you in the right direction.


If you read books, consider taking the work of your favorite author. Famous books like Alice in

Wonderland have been analyzed and interpreted in many different ways; there should be plenty of

source material you could use for reference.

**5.4** **Culture Critical Thinking Topics**


  - Pick a sport that famously had a drug abuse history. Summarize and assess the situation and

how it affected the competition.

  - College football plays a vital role in American Universities. How does it change the

community, the spirit, and the economics of the college?

  - Gain a deeper understanding of homelessness in your city. Why is it a problem and which

resources can the city use to help?

  - Anti-drug campaigns often cause more problems than solutions. Take a look at a similar

campaign and analyze its effectiveness.

  - Take a look at how women are portrayed in a particular medium today. For example the

medium of Cinema. Has sexism that polluted 50’s Hollywood been wholly removed from

movies?


**5.5** **Mass Media Topics**


  - Take a film. What is the message, and how does the director convey it?

  - Analyze a graphic novel. What is the message/passage, and how does it push the

possibilities of the visual novel medium?

  - Observe the remake of a classic motion picture. What has changed?

  - Examine the influence of a popular TV series on youth.

  - Take Facebook. What was the initial idea? Has it grown consistently with the internet and

how people use it?


**5.6** **Critical Evaluation Topics on History**


  - Compare Ancient Greece to today. Are the practices, teachings, and rituals of the Ancient

Greeks still relevant?

  - Colonization of America was a brutal time in history. Looking back at it, could we have

done it without killing the indigenous people of America?

  - Ancient Egypt. Tackle the controversies surrounding the pyramids of Giza. Was it slaves or

aliens who built them?

  - World War II. Some say that it was a necessary tragedy that shaped the modern world.

Present and analyze this controversial opinion.

  - Ancient Rome borrowed heavily from Ancient Greek and Egyptian culture and art.

However, when Mussolini came around, he wanted to preserve the classic Italian aesthetic

of Ancient Rome. Analyze the irony of the ultra-right Fascist movement in light of these

facts.


**Culture Critical Thinking Topics in Literature**


  - Analyze Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn and its impact on racism in America.

  - Take a dystopian novel like 1984 or Brave New World and compare it to society today.

  - J.R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire is a profoundly subversive series in its genre. How

does Martin achieve this, in comparison to Lord of the Rings?

  - Analyze Orwell’s Animal Farm and compare it to the real history of the Soviet Union.

_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


  - Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar is purposely wrongly named as the actual protagonist is Brutus.

Analyze how this relates to the plot and theme of the play.


**Culture Critical Thinking Topics in Sports**


  - Money ruined sports. Analyze the argument to establish whether it’s true or false.

  - Analyze the effect of betting on the sporting community.

  - Cristiano Ronaldo is known to be a bit of an actor on the field. Analyze the validity of this

claim.

  - Should cybersports be considered sports?

  - Some say that FIFA releases the same game every year, exploiting the sports gaming

community. Challenge the validity of this claim.


**5.7** **How to Write a Critical Analysis**

First of all, read all the sources you will use to support your opinions carefully. Most likely, you
already have a solid opinion on the matter of your critical analysis essay, however, look at the
problem from multiple perspectives to be more objective and open-minded. When reading other
people’s works on the subject, identify their thesis and carefully include it as supporting evidence
for your main argument.

Presenting other people’s opinions shows you as a considerate writer. Carefully think about your
response and reaction to the subject matter of your essay. Make sure your opinions are not
offensive to anyone who might read your essay and make sure that you take the different
backgrounds and experiences people might have into consideration.

Next, draft your essay. Start by including an overview of your subject and its key points, and draw
your reader toward your thesis statement. Each of your body paragraphs has to have a new point
for your analysis. The point of each paragraph has to be fair; avoid extreme bias and any irregular
needs to prove your arguments effectively.

Lastly, your conclusion has to reiterate each point you have made and restate your overall
opinion. Without further ado, let’s learn how to write a critical analysis essay step by step.


**Step 1: Critical Reading**

The initial step to critical analysis to read carefully and thoroughly, identifying the author’s thesis.
Most of your information will come from reading different sources and understanding different
takes and opinions on the same issue. You must pay attention to details, recognize the author's’
rhetorical devices, biases, and assumptions.

**Whenever reading a source, always look out for:**


 - **The author’s intended audience** . Good writers write in a specific way to appeal to a

particular audience; ex. Playful language appeals to kids, statistics appeal to business

people.

 - **The author’s means of persuasion** (language and rhetoric.) Good writers won’t directly say

that Burger King is unhealthy, they will present BK’s sick list of ingredients and let the

reader make this assumption.

 - **The general structure of the writing and how it supports the author’s statements** . A blog

post about the importance of punctuation, like commas, may illustrate, how, many people,

annoyingly, overuse, commas, just, like, this.

As a critical reader, it is your job to pinpoint the author’s motives and dissect the text for meaning.
Understanding how the author tries to achieve their purposes and gain your trust is the whole
point of critical reading.


**Lovely Professional University** **45**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 05: Analysing a Topic for and Essay or Report**_


**Step 2: Critical Analysis Writing**

The first thing to remember is that your job is not to de-legitimize this author’s work. Your post is
to serve the reader by exploring the work with them, opening up aspects that were ignored or
neglected. It is your duty to help the world understand the subject to the fullest extent.


**Summary**

The first thing to do is provide a summary of your source (event, article, work of art, etc.). This is
done to demonstrate that you have fully understood what you’re talking about. Summaries should
not contain your argument or show any bias towards the source you’re about to discuss.

**If the source is a text (as it will most likely be), address the following aspects:**


  - How has the author organized the text?

  - Identify the intended audience and why the author has targeted them.

  - Identify the author’s assumptions about the intended audience.

  - List and explain the rhetorical devices, language, and imagery that the author uses in the

text.

**Creating a Critical Analysis Essay Outline**

An outline helps to put your arguments in order. Creating a good overview will help you write a
critical analysis essay fast and be consistent with your message. Most instructors will provide a
sample of a critical analysis essay outline to help you write a well-organized analysis paper. Before
writing a critical analysis essay, make sure you have an outline which organizes your thoughts into
a coherent critical essay structure.

**Here is a sample critical essay outline you may use for reference:**

  - **Background Information:** Give the reader some context; help them understand the

nature of the work.

  - **Information**

        - Title

        - Author

        - Publication information

        - Statement of topic and purpose

  - **Thesis statement:** After giving the reader some context, provide your reaction to the work in

a thesis statement.

  - **Summary:** Demonstrate your understanding of the source, as described in the Summary

section above.

  - **Critical Analysis** (Interpretation and Evaluation): Here is where you finally present your

analysis of the work based on your reading and critical evaluation.

        - Talk about how the **source is organized** ;

        - Discuss **the style and rhetoric** of the source;

        - How **Effective** was the source and the message;

        - **How was the topic treated** was the writer biased or did he do it justice?

        - Discuss how the source **appealed to its target audience.**


Conclude the essay with a traditional essay conclusion by restating the thesis and offering some

final thoughts. Summarize your reactions and outtakes from your analysis.


**Techniques Used in Literary Critiques**


**46** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


 - **An Objective Analysis**  - Evaluation based only on facts; without using feeling or emotion

in the study.

 - **Traditional Critique**  - Critique based on a collective agreement of sources that literate and

educated people should know.

 - **New Critique**  - Critique that is concentrated on just the text itself. Areas of irony,

metaphor, ambiguity, and paradox are under close evaluation.

 - **Marxist Criticism**  - Analogy through class conflicts and identification, coming to

conclusions of a political or social nature. Marxist criticism has had a profound effect on the

understanding of literature.

 - **Metaphorical Critique**  - Close attention to metaphors to form a deeper understanding of

the work and its author.

 - **New Historicism**  - The study of literature based on its historical value.

 - **Psychological Critique**  - Freudian critique, where the author's unconscious wishes, just

like dreams, can be evaluated as a pathway to their mind.

 - **Sociological Criticism**  - Mainly focuses on how the literature represents social functions

but also where the work fits into society in general.

 - **Moral or Ethical Criticism**  - Judging the work or literary piece by the morals learned from

the text.


**How to write an analysis report?**

Usually, an analysis report must first be in an outline form so you will have a general knowledge
on the topic as a whole. Without an outline, you may not know where you are heading to, and the
flow of your write-up may not direct you to the generalization that you want to come up with.
Hence, you must follow your outline for you to stay on track.


**What are some analytical essay topics?**

Analytical essay topics can range from something like a book or a poem to a real-life event or story.
The idea is to research the chosen topic, analyze it, and then give your own opinions and
conclusions.


**What makes a report a report?**

Real-time suggestions, wherever you write. A report is a nonfiction account that presents and/or
summarizes the facts about a particular event, topic, or issue. The idea is that people who are
unfamiliar with the subject can find everything they need to know from a good report.


**How to write a good report?**

Usually, reports are written in the past tense. The action steps can included references to future
actions. You must only report what you actually did and what you found. In your final section, you
must not anymore introduce a new topic since this would be your closing and concluding remarks.

**Learning Objectives**


 - Revise your essay to improve organization and cohesion.

 - Determine an appropriate style and tone for your essay.

 - Revise to ensure that your tone is consistent.

 - Edit your essay to ensure that language, citations, and formatting are correct.

 - Given all the time and effort you have put into your research project, you will want to make

sure that your final draft represents your best work. This requires taking the time to revise

and edit your essay carefully.

 - You may feel like you need a break from your essay before you revise and edit it. That is

understandable—but leave yourself with enough time to complete this important stage of the

writing process. In this section, you will learn the following specific strategies that are useful

for revising and editing a research essay:

 - How to evaluate and improve the overall organization and cohesion

 - How to maintain an appropriate style and tone

 - How to use checklists to identify and correct any errors in language, citations, and formatting


**6.4** **Revising Your Essay: Organization and Cohesion**


 - When writing a research essay, it is easy to become overly focused on editorial details, such as

the proper format for bibliographical entries. These details do matter. However, before you

begin to address them, it is important to spend time reviewing and revising the content of the

essay.

 - A good research paper is both organized and cohesive. Organization means that your

argument flows logically from one point to the next. Cohesion means that the elements of

your paper work together smoothly and naturally. In a cohesive research essay, information

from research is seamlessly integrated with the writer’s ideas.


**6.5** **Revise to Improve Organization**

When you revise to improve organization, you look at the flow of ideas throughout the essay as a
whole and within individual paragraphs. You check to see that your essay moves logically from the
introduction to the body paragraphs to the conclusion, and that each section reinforces your thesis


 - Revision: Organization

 - **At the essay level**


 - Does my introduction proceed clearly from the opening to the thesis?

 - Does each body paragraph have a clear main idea that relates to the thesis?

 - Do the main ideas in the body paragraphs flow in a logical order? Is each paragraph

connected to the one before it?

 - Do I need to add or revise topic sentences or transitions to make the overall flow of ideas

clearer?

 - Does my conclusion summarize my main ideas and revisit my thesis?

 - Revision: Organization

 - **At the essay level**


 - Does my introduction proceed clearly from the opening to the thesis?

 - Does each body paragraph have a clear main idea that relates to the thesis?


**Lovely Professional University** **55**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


      - **At the paragraph level**


      - Does the topic sentence clearly state the main idea?

      - Do the details in the paragraph relate to the main idea?

      - Do I need to recast any sentences or add transitions to improve the flow of sentences?

      - Jorge reread his draft paragraph by paragraph. As he read, he highlighted the main idea of

each paragraph so he could see whether his ideas proceeded in a logical order. For the most

part, the flow of ideas was clear. However, he did notice that one paragraph did not have a

clear main idea. It interrupted the flow of the writing. During revision, Jorge added a topic

sentence that clearly connected the paragraph to the one that had preceded it. He also added

transitions to improve the flow of ideas from sentence to sentence.

      - Do the main ideas in the body paragraphs flow in a logical order? Is each paragraph

connected to the one before it?

      - Do I need to add or revise topic sentences or transitions to make the overall flow of ideas

clearer?

      - Does my conclusion summarize my main ideas and revisit my thesis?

      - **Revise to Improve Cohesion**


      - When you revise to improve cohesion, you analyze how the parts of your essay work

together. You look for anything that seems awkward or out of place. Revision may involve

deleting unnecessary material or rewriting parts of the essay so that the out-of-place material

fits in smoothly.

In a research essay, problems with cohesion usually occur when a writer has trouble integrating
source material. If facts or quotations have been awkwardly dropped into a paragraph, they
distract or confuse the reader instead of working to support the writer’s point. Overusing
paraphrased and quoted material has the same effect

      - **Revision: Cohesion**


      - Does the opening of the essay clearly connect to the broader topic and thesis? Make sure

entertaining quotes or anecdotes serve a purpose.

      - Have I included support from research for each main point in the body of my essay?

      - Have I included introductory material before any quotations? Quotations should never stand

alone in a paragraph.

      - Does paraphrased and quoted material clearly serve to develop my own points?

      - Do I need to add to or revise parts of the paper to help the reader understand how certain

information from a source is relevant?

      - Are there any places where I have overused material from sources?

      - Does my conclusion make sense based on the rest of the essay? Make sure any new questions

or suggestions in the conclusion are clearly linked to earlier material.

      - **Collaboration**

      - **Writing at Work**


      - Understanding cohesion can also benefit you in the workplace, especially when you have to

write and deliver a presentation. Speakers sometimes rely on cute graphics or funny

quotations to hold their audience’s attention. If you choose to use these elements, make sure

they work well with the substantive content of your presentation. For example, if you are

asked to give a financial presentation, and the financial report shows that the company lost

money, funny illustrations would not be relevant or appropriate for the presentation.

 - **Using a Consistent Style and Tone**


 - Once you are certain that the content of your essay fulfills your purpose, you can begin

revising to improve style and tone. Together, your style and tone create the voice of your

essay, or how you come across to readers. Style refers to the way you use language as a

writer—the sentence structures you use and the word choices you make. Tone is the attitude

toward your subject and audience that you convey through your word choice.

 - **Determining an Appropriate Style and Tone**


 - Although accepted writing styles will vary within different disciplines, the underlying goal is

the same—to come across to your readers as a knowledgeable, authoritative guide. Writing

about research is like being a tour guide who walks readers through a topic. A stuffy, overly

formal tour guide can make readers feel put off or intimidated. Too much informality or

humor can make readers wonder whether the tour guide really knows what he or she is

talking about. Extreme or emotionally charged language comes across as unbalanced.

 - To help prevent being overly formal or informal, determine an appropriate style and tone at

the beginning of the research process. Consider your topic and audience because these can

help dictate style and tone. For example, an essay on new breakthroughs in cancer research

should be more formal than an essay on ways to get a good night’s sleep.

 - **Word Choice**


 - Note that word choice is an especially important aspect of style. In addition to checking the

points noted on Checklist 12.3, review your paper to make sure your language is precise,

conveys no unintended connotations, and is free of biases. Here are some of the points to

check for:

 - Vague or imprecise terms

 - Slang

 - Repetition of the same phrases (“Smith states…, Jones states…”) to introduce quoted and

paraphrased material

A strong research essay comes across as straightforward, appropriately academic, and serious. It is
generally best to avoid writing in the first person, as this can make your paper seem overly
subjective and opinion based

 - **Style**


 - My essay avoids excessive wordiness.

 - My sentences are varied in length and structure.

 - I have avoided using first-person pronouns such as I and we.

 - I have used the active voice whenever possible.

 - I have defined specialized terms that might be unfamiliar to readers.

 - I have used clear, straightforward language whenever possible and avoided unnecessary

jargon.

 - My essay states my point of view using a balanced tone—neither too indecisive nor too

forceful.


 - **Keeping Your Style Consistent**


 - As you revise your essay, make sure your style is consistent throughout. Look for instances

where a word, phrase, or sentence just does not seem to fit with the rest of the writing. It is


**Lovely Professional University** **57**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


best to reread for style after you have completed the other revisions so that you are not

distracted by any larger content issues. Revising strategies you can use include the following:

      - **Read your essay aloud.** Sometimes your ears catch inconsistencies that your eyes miss.

      - **Share your essay with** **another reader whom you trust to give you honest feedback.** It is

often difficult to evaluate one’s own style objectively—especially in the final phase of a

challenging writing project. Another reader may be more likely to notice instances of

wordiness, confusing language, or other issues that affect style and tone.

**Line-edit your essay slowly, sentence by sentence.** You may even wish to use a ruler or sheet of
paper to cover everything on the page except the paragraph you are editing—that forces you to
read slowly and carefully. Mark any areas where you notice problems in style or tone, and then
take time to rework those sections

      - **Editing Your Essay**


      - After revising your essay to address problems in content or style, you will complete one final

editorial review. Perhaps you already have caught and corrected minor mistakes during

previous revisions. Nevertheless, give your draft a final edit to make sure it is error-free. Your

final edit should focus on two broad areas:

      - Errors in grammar, mechanics, usage, and spelling

      - Errors in citing and formatting sources

      - **Correcting Errors**

Given how much work you have put into your research paper, you will want to check for any
errors that could distract or confuse your readers. Using the spell-checking feature in your wordprocessing program can be helpful—but this should not replace a full, careful review of your
document. Be sure to check for any errors that may have come up frequently for you in the past.

      - **Checking Citations and Formatting**

When editing a research essay, it is also important to check that you have cited sources properly
and formatted your document according to the specified guidelines. There are two reasons for this.
First and foremost, citing sources correctly ensures that you have given proper credit to other
people for ideas and information that helped you in your work. Second, using correct formatting
establishes your paper as one student’s contribution to the work developed by and for a larger
academic community. Increasingly, American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines are
the standard for many academic fields. Modern Language Association (MLA) is also a standard
style in many fields.

      - **Citations and Formatting**


      - Within the body of my essay, each fact or idea taken from a source is credited to the correct

source.

      - Each in-text citation includes the source author’s name (or, where applicable, the organization

name or source title) and year of publication. I have used the correct format of in-text and

parenthetical citations.

      - Each source cited in the body of my essay has a corresponding entry in the references section

of my paper.

      - My references section includes a heading and double-spaced, alphabetized entries.

      - Each entry in my references section is indented on the second line and all subsequent lines.

      - Each entry in my references section includes all the necessary information for that source type,

in the correct sequence and format.

      - My essay includes a title page.

      - My essay includes a running head.

_**Notes**_



_**Unit 06: Editing the Draft and Preparing the Final Draft**_


 - The margins of my essay are set at one inch. Text is double spaced and set in a standard 12
point font.

 - **Writing at Work**


 - Following APA or MLA citation and formatting guidelines may require time and effort.

However, it is good practice for learning how to follow accepted conventions in any

professional field. Many large corporations create a style manual with guidelines for editing

and formatting documents produced by that corporation. Employees follow the style manual

when creating internal documents and documents for publication.

 - During the process of revising and editing, Jorge made changes in the content and style of his

essay. He also gave the paper a final review to check for overall correctness and, particularly,

correct APA or MLA citations and formatting. Read the final draft of his essay.

 - **Key Takeaways**


 - Organization in a research essay means that the argument proceeds logically from the

introduction to the body to the conclusion. It flows logically from one point to the next. When

revising a research essay, evaluate the organization of the essay as a whole and the

organization of individual paragraphs.

 - In a cohesive research essay, the elements of the essay work together smoothly and naturally.

When revising a research essay, evaluate its cohesion. In particular, check that information

from research is smoothly integrated with your ideas.

 - An effective research essay uses a style and tone that are appropriately academic and serious.

 - Editing a research essay involves checking for errors in grammar, mechanics, punctuation,

usage, spelling, citations, and formatting.

**Objectives**


 - Writing an essay takes time. That’s why writing is often referred to as a process. In other

words, a writer goes through several steps before he or she has a complete essay ready to turn

in for a grade. This lesson talk about those

 - The steps of the writing process:

 - Pre- writing

 - Organizing

 - Drafting

 - Revising and Editing

 - Handling in a final copy


STEPS FOR WRITING A DRAFT


 - After prewriting, deciding on a thesis, and developing & organizing evidence, you’re ready to

write a first draft -- a rough, provisional version of your essay in which you provide:

paragraphs that support your thesis all relevant examples, facts, and opinions sequence your

material as effective as you can

 - You may find that… But that’s OK--- Remember, writing is a PROCESS

Your thesis has to be reconsidered or reshaped a point no longer fits you have to return to

prewriting to generate additional material But that’s OK--- Remember, writing is a PROCESS

 - How do I move from the outline to the first draft?


**Lovely Professional University** **61**


_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_

There is no RIGHT WAY to do it Some people rely heavily on prewriting, scratch notes, and

outlines. Others only glance at them occasionally. Some people type their first draft. Others

prefer to start with a handwritten draft.

         - What if I get a new idea? It is OK (actually, great) if you get fresh ideas while drafting. Go

ahead and throw promising new thoughts in and go back and evaluate them during

revision. **What if I get stuck? It’s OK (actually, it’s quite normal)**

REMEMBER, it’s a ROUGH draft; it doesn’t have to be perfect! Relax. Don’t be critical. Work

quickly. Don’t worry about perfect spelling or grammar Feel free to skip down to another part

of the paper Consider rereading what you’ve already written – OUT LOUD

         - **Write the supporting paragraphs 1** **[st]**

Since the introduction depends heavily on everything that follows and is the bait to catch the

reader’s attention, consider writing the body paragraphs 1stGo ahead and write out your

thesis, though, to keep you focused Keep your supporting paragraphs focused with a topic

sentence (a main point from your thesis or roman numeral from your outline)Think of this as

a mini-thesis for each paragraph.

         - **Make your supporting paragraphs specific**

Provide examples that answer who, what, which and similar questions Replace general nouns

and adjectives with precise/specific ones Old car            - beat-up car            - rusty, dented, old Chevy

pick-up Replace general verbs with vivid ones They seemed excited           - They whistled and

cheered Replace abstract words with concrete ones Use imagery (words that appeal to the 5

senses) Provide adequate support for your points

         - **Grab the reader’s attention--- Write the Introduction**

Hook the reader with one of the following: A brief anecdotes quotation Onomatopoeia

dramatic fact or statistic Briefly providing some background information

         - **Wrap it up--- Write the Conclusion**

Don’t just stop writing after your final point. Your reader deserves a satisfying ending

Consider saving a compelling fact, statistic, quote, or detail for the end Consider returning to

and referencing an image, idea or anecdote used in the introduction Consider driving home

your point by rephrasing your thesis You may sum up your argument, make a prediction

based on the information you provided, or call your reader to some sort of action

**7.3** **Revising Your Essay: Organization and Cohesion**


 - When writing a research essay, it is easy to become overly focused on editorial details, such as

the proper format for bibliographical entries. These details do matter. However, before you

begin to address them, it is important to spend time reviewing and revising the content of the

essay.

 - A good research paper is both organized and cohesive. Organization means that your

argument flows logically from one point to the next. Cohesion means that the elements of

your paper work together smoothly and naturally. In a cohesive research essay, information

from research is seamlessly integrated with the writer’s ideas.


**7.4** **Revise to Improve Organization**

When you revise to improve organization, you look at the flow of ideas throughout the essay as a
whole and within individual paragraphs. You check to see that your essay moves logically from the
introduction to the body paragraphs to the conclusion, and that each section reinforces your thesis


 - Revision: Organization

 - **At the essay level**

 - Does my introduction proceed clearly from the opening to the thesis?

 - Does each body paragraph have a clear main idea that relates to the thesis?

 - Do the main ideas in the body paragraphs flow in a logical order? Is each paragraph

connected to the one before it?

 - Do I need to add or revise topic sentences or transitions to make the overall flow of ideas

clearer?

 - Does my conclusion summarize my main ideas and revisit my thesis?

 - Revision: Organization

 - **At the essay level**


 - Does my introduction proceed clearly from the opening to the thesis?

 - Does each body paragraph have a clear main idea that relates to the thesis?

 - **At the paragraph level**

 - Does the topic sentence clearly state the main idea?

 - Do the details in the paragraph relate to the main idea?

 - Do I need to recast any sentences or add transitions to improve the flow of sentences?

 - Jorge reread his draft paragraph by paragraph. As he read, he highlighted the main idea of

each paragraph so he could see whether his ideas proceeded in a logical order. For the most

part, the flow of ideas was clear. However, he did notice that one paragraph did not have a

clear main idea. It interrupted the flow of the writing. During revision, Jorge added a topic

sentence that clearly connected the paragraph to the one that had preceded it. He also added

transitions to improve the flow of ideas from sentence to sentence.

 - Do the main ideas in the body paragraphs flow in a logical order? Is each paragraph

connected to the one before it?

 - Do I need to add or revise topic sentences or transitions to make the overall flow of ideas

clearer?

 - Does my conclusion summarize my main ideas and revisit my thesis?

 - **Revise to Improve Cohesion**

 - When you revise to improve cohesion, you analyze how the parts of your essay work

together. You look for anything that seems awkward or out of place. Revision may involve


**Lovely Professional University** **65**


_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_

deleting unnecessary material or rewriting parts of the essay so that the out-of-place material

fits in smoothly.

In a research essay, problems with cohesion usually occur when a writer has trouble
integrating source material. If facts or quotations have been awkwardly dropped into a
paragraph, they distract or confuse the reader instead of working to support the writer’s point.
Overusing paraphrased and quoted material has the same effect


         - **Revision: Cohesion**

         - Does the opening of the essay clearly connect to the broader topic and thesis? Make sure

entertaining quotes or anecdotes serve a purpose.

         - Have I included support from research for each main point in the body of my essay?

         - Have I included introductory material before any quotations? Quotations should never stand

alone in a paragraph.

         - Does paraphrased and quoted material clearly serve to develop my own points?

         - Do I need to add to or revise parts of the paper to help the reader understand how certain

information from a source is relevant?

         - Are there any places where I have overused material from sources?

         - Does my conclusion make sense based on the rest of the essay? Make sure any new questions

or suggestions in the conclusion are clearly linked to earlier material.

         - **Collaboration**

         - **Writing at Work**

         - Understanding cohesion can also benefit you in the workplace, especially when you have to

_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


_my room is too small for me_


_suppose I die before graduation_


_they will sing sad melodies_


_but finally_


_tell the truth about me_


_There is nothing I want to do_


_and too much_


_that has to be done_


_and momma’s in the bedroom_


_with the door closed.”_


**Summary**

These words introduce the concept of peer pressure and how it impacts all young brains. The
narrator interprets it as pressure to pick up dancing before the start of the subsequent celebration. It
seems as though this will determine whether the writer is accepted by his or her group of friends.

She does not really want to accomplish anything, although mentioning that she needs to learn how
to dance, which suggests that she is trying to elevate her social standing. Her demeanour suggests
that she has reached a point of surrender and is unsure of how to move forward in life.

She longs for her mother's presence but lacks the essential parental supervision. She worries about
how people will react if she dies. She is confident that once they initially mourn her passing, they
will reveal the truth. However, the definition of "truth" is still vague. It probably implies that the
narrator did not accomplish anything in her life that would be remembered after her passing.


**8.1** **Purpose of a summary**

The purpose of a summary is to present readers with a concise overview of vital details or
fascinating information without introducing a personal opinion. A summary is a quick overview of
the key points of a text or piece of media, such as an abstract for a scientific article, a plot
description for a movie, or a synopsis for a poetry or novel.


**8.2 A Framework for Writing a Summary**

**Before drafting a summary, ask yourself the following questions:**


  - What are the primary points presented in the passage?

  - What is the passage about?

  - What is the tone?

  - What kind of writing is it?

  - What key details and points back up the ideas?

  - Are the sections pertinent to the passage?

  - What is the passage's irrelevant information?

  - How would you begin writing a headline or heading for the passage in your own words?


**Lovely Professional University** **71**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 08: Summarize a Piece of Prose or Poetry**_


A summary never uses idioms, metaphors, sayings, or a complex English writing style; it is always
very straightforward and simple to understand. Almost always, the summary is written in the
author's own words. However, specific words from the passage can be used as keywords.


**8.3 Types of Summary**

The two major types of summaries are descriptive and evaluative. Not all summaries will perfectly
fit into one of these categories, as is the case with many different types of writing, but you can use
these descriptions as a guide when writing a summary.

**Descriptive:** The foundation of a descriptive summary is the expression of facts. The essential idea
of the subject under consideration is highlighted, together with any crucial supporting information.
Rarely will you find the author's viewpoint in a descriptive synopsis. It is a succinct explanation of
the work, which implies the writer utilizes the fewest number of words necessary to communicate
the key ideas of the thing being described.


**Evaluative:** As the name "evaluative" implies, the writer of this kind of summary must assess the
subject matter. This type of summary contains a lot of personal opinions. While a few fundamental
details about the work, including the author, title, and major idea, are necessary, the remaining text
is made up of the summary writer's opinions about the work. The author will discuss how well the
targeted audience and purpose—as well as how well these are addressed in the work—have been
addressed in the piece. The individual giving the item an evaluation will also consider how the
item will benefit him or her personally and will assess any shortcomings. The evaluative summary
may be longer than the typical descriptive summary since it may require comprehensive
description of the types and frequency of examination.

**When are they used?**

**Descriptive:** When attempting to grasp and convey what the author of the original material said, a
writer will employ a descriptive summary.

**Evaluative:** When evaluating the original material for usefulness, validity, argument strength, or
other crucial components, a writer will opt for this summary type.

**Example of Descriptive Summary:** Let’s understand descriptive summary, by looking at the
summary of the essay “A Modest Proposal”, by Jonathan Swift.

The essay is one of the most brutal and sardonic pamphlets ever written and is rightly labeled "A
Modest Proposal." An unidentified personage who speaks in the article and is referred to as the
"Proposer" suggests "innocently" and "modestly" using Irish impoverished people's children as food
for affluent individuals to fight poverty in the eighteenth century. The essay is structured as a
traditional rhetorical piece advocating an idea or concept, mimicking the manner of a scientific
social study _._


**Example of Evaluative Summary:** Here’s an example of an evaluative summary of “The Road
Less Travelled”, written by M. Scott Peck.

In The Road Less Traveled, Scott Peck shows us how to deal with life's difficulties, develop through
adversity, and finally achieve greater self-knowledge. Three underlying presumptions support The
Road Less Traveled:


 - The spirit and mind are intertwined (mental growth is spiritual growth and vice versa).

 - Growing spiritually is a difficult, lifelong process.

 - Ultimate goal of life is to achieve complete spiritual competence and spiritual power.

Our primary motivation in life, in Peck's opinion, is to advance spiritually. The fact that spiritual
progress can only take place by conquering problems is our biggest barrier to it. Since acceptance
requires facing our difficulties, which is frequently uncomfortable or painful, we would rather
whine, suffer, and resist. But putting off spiritual development inevitably results in bad mental
health. The incapacity to face challenges and the suffering or discomfort they cause is, in reality, the
root of mental disease. Avoiding issues results in slower growth and more misery.


**72** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


On the other hand, facing and resolving our own issues gives us courage and opens the door to
wisdom. To achieve this, we must cultivate discipline and grace (along with love and personal
religion, or worldview). Through the prism of his experiences as a psychotherapist, Scott Peck
offers an in-depth examination of these techniques in “The Road Less Traveled.”

The author of The Road Less Traveled, Scott Peck, identifies two major barriers to spiritual
development.

**a. Laziness**

Being lazy prevents us from solving the issues that promote our development. Furthermore, if we
don't overcome laziness, we won't be able to overcome the other challenges; however, if we do, we
will be certain that we can also overcome the others.

**b. Fear of Power**

As we grow spiritually, we become more conscious of the effects of our activities. As knowing how
our actions will affect others also implies knowing the misery and pain we might bring about, this
makes choosing decisions more challenging. The more spiritual awareness we get, the more
uncertain we could feel.

Now that we have talked about the two primary types of summaries—descriptive and evaluative—
and some potential uses for each, let's move on to some useful advice for writing summaries. These
tips will cover how to organize your summary, which information you should include from the
original text, and a few tricky grammar points.


**8.4** **Organizing Summary**

A summary will almost always be structured according to the original text's overall structure. Keep
in mind that the purpose of a descriptive summary is to communicate the same ideas as the original
text in a shorter amount of time. This may not always be the case, particularly when writing critical
summaries. Even though it is still crucial to convey the text's core ideas, you could wish to use your
organization to draw attention to some of the text's advantages or shortcomings.


**8.5** **Including Details**

Choosing which facts and information to include in a summary is one of the most typical challenges
a writer encounters. It can be challenging to strike a balance between offering vital facts and giving
the reader the whole picture in a summary, whether it be descriptive or evaluative. Here are some
pointers for choosing which specifics to include:

**A.** **Provide examples**

For each main point that is discussed in the body of your summary, provide no more than one or
two examples. Always keep in mind that the goal of a descriptive summary, especially, is to
provide a general understanding of the text's subject matter. When analyzing a specific notion from
the text in an evaluative summary, it may be helpful to include further information or examples.

**B.** **Add necessary details**


When writing, and especially when editing, think about whether the examples or details you use
are necessary to clarify or bolster the text's major points. Will your reader be able to comprehend
your text's thesis and key arguments without the information or example?

**C.** **Write in your own words**


Unless you are giving specific information (numbers, significant quotes, etc.), express details and
examples in your own words. Avoid the trap of just copying and pasting data from the original
text. Even when a direct quote is correctly referenced, using too many of them results in a summary
that is more like a patchwork of the original text than a concise summary in your own words that
captures the essence and major idea of the text.

**D.** **Use of grammatical features**


**Lovely Professional University** **73**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 08: Summarize a Piece of Prose or Poetry**_


There are a few grammatical features common to summaries that may appear trivial or
unimportant, but can have a substantial impact on the content of your text.

Let's start with the following extremely basic summary. Pay close attention to the verbs, how and
when they are employed, and their tense. Make a list of what you notice.


_Kurt Weisenfeld, a professor of Physics at Georgia Tech University, argues in his essay "Making the Grade"_
_that there has been a visible drop in his students' work ethic over the last generation. Based on his personal_
_encounters with his pupils, he discovered that many of them failed to see the link between their final grades_
_and their own personal hard work (or lack thereof). Rather, they appeared to believe they were just entitled to_
_the grades they desired. Weisenfeld theorizes that their apathy toward learning stems from a society saturated_
_with superficial values and the "erosion of quality control" in the public education system (e.g. giving out_
_grades that were not really earned). Since the majority of his students specialize in science and engineering,_
_he worries that their lack of a work ethic and "hyper rational thinking" may create expensive or harmful_
_engineering mishaps._


**This summary has two key components that are crucial for any summary:**

The author use verbs that suggest summarization. Kurt Weisenfeld, for instance, **"argues,"**
**"theorizes that,"** and " **he worries that** " The reader of your summary, will typically be aware that
you are summarizing from another source. Even so, it's still critical to note that you are
summarizing in order to make sure you are not substituting your own views for those of the
author. Keeping the author's ideas and your appraisal of those ideas apart is crucial when
producing an evaluative summary.


In addition to using the past tense (" **discovered** "), the author also frequently utilizes the present
tense ( **"argues," "theorizes," and "fears"** ). Which tenses do you think the author used, and why?
What would change if it’s written "Weisenfeld theorized that..."? Almost all academic writers,
regardless of how long they have been writing, struggle with the use of tense when discussing
someone else's work or writing, and unfortunately, there are no strict guidelines as to which tense
should be used when. However, there are some broad guidelines that can assist you in selecting the
appropriate tense:


In general, the present tense is employed to describe an author's thought or argument in the text.
Consider a text as if the author is speaking directly to you. Although the author completed writing
this notion at some point in the past, they are continuing making this remark or argument through
the text at present time. An exception would be if you know for a certainty that the author has since
abandoned or no longer believes the idea.


The past tense is typically employed to describe an event or activity that takes place in a text. This is
frequently used, for instance, to discuss the methods or circumstances the author utilized to arrive
at the conclusion or support the arguments.


It is necessary to keep in mind that the usage of tense can also reveal the writer's perspective on the
reported topic. If the writer utilizes the present tense, he or she is not challenging the notion,
rather accepting it as currently valid. If the writer uses the past tense, he or she will frequently go
on to demonstrate that the idea is no longer valid or that the writer disagrees with it.


**8.6** **Avoid Plagiaris**

A summary is a restatement of someone else's work, making it relatively simple to mistakenly
plagiarize. We'll go through some situations where it can be very simple to plagiarize


**74** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


unintentionally, some advice for preventing plagiarism while summarizing, and when we need to
cite in a summary in the section that follows.


When can plagiarism occur?

It can be easy to plagiarize words while summarizing someone else's writing, as we learned in the
previous section, particularly when detailing the particulars and nuances of an author's argument
or justification for that point. Many authors may mistakenly feel that it is not required to quote or
cite terms that are directly taken because the reader usually understands that a summary is derived
from another source. However, you must always give acknowledgment for directly copied text, just
like with any other usage of outside content. It will also be easier for you to maintain your retelling
of the author's ideas apart from your own interpretation or evaluation of those ideas, especially if
you are writing an evaluative summary, if you use verbs that denote that you are summarizing
from another text.

When is it required to cite a summary?

Citations are classified into two types: full reference citations and in-text citations, both of which are
necessary when producing any form of summary. It will help to remember the reasons we cite.
First, to acknowledge someone else's contribution, and second, to assist our reader in locating the
mentioned content.


**8.7** **Steps to summarize a passage**


 - After you've read the passage once, read it again slowly.

 - As you read the passage, make a list of key topics and keywords to add in your summary.

 - When you have completed your summary, read it to ensure that it is identical to the original

section.

 - Summarize each section, paragraph, or segment in one to two sentences.


**8.8** **Tips for writing an effective summary**


  - **Find the main idea:** Identify the core theme of the text. A useful summary condenses the

source information to its most important point in order to inform the reader. Choose the

main message you want to express to the reader and use your restricted sentences

effectively. Make a few notes to help you outline your thoughts in an organized fashion.

  - **Keep it concise:** A summary is not a rewriting; rather, it is a brief description of the

original text. A summary paragraph is typically composed of five to eight sentences. Keep it

concise and to-the-point. To keep your paragraph simple and brief, remove any

redundancies or repeating text.

  - **Write without preconception:** When you sum up an original document or piece of

media, you are gathering and distilling its most important information, not creating a

review. Write your summary in your own words, without stating your opinion.

  - **Maintain the coherence:** Make certain that your summary is coherent and in momentum.

Transitions are quite useful for establishing momentum in your writing. Connect your

phrases with transition words to ensure they flow together and properly explain your

summary.

**Objectives**

Students will be able to


  - Identify the meaning of several idiomatic phrases after completing this unit.

  - Learn to use some of the idioms that are frequently used.

  - Be familiar with the punctuation marks.


**Introduction**

Because the English language is so flexible, new idiomatic expressions, borrowings, and neologisms
occasionally refill its supply while also adding to the vocabulary of language users. English's
linguistic diversity is astounding. Idioms and proverbs in English are groupings of words with
specific meanings that reflect the essence of the language. These metaphorical word groups or
sentences convey meanings that are not obvious from word definitions. These idioms, which native
English speakers frequently employ, show the unique tenor of the English language.

English idioms and proverbs are often used in written and spoken form in both formal and
informal settings. These prefabricated components are great teaching aids for learning the language
because of how frequently they are used. Idiomatic expressions are most commonly seen in oral or
written dialogue. It can enhance our communication skills.

Speaking out loud is not considered communication. It is only one aspect of it. Only a few people
are actually able to appreciate the beauty of communication, which is an art. It includes whatever
cues our body language could suggest. It is seen by many as a more effective form of
communication. The places we pause, the phrases we pay attention to, and our facial emotions all
influence our body language.

However, while writing, body language is not allowed. Yet many individuals are able to
wonderfully express their emotions using this technique. In written form, correct punctuation
reflects body language and supports the expression of our emotions. What makes this up are the
word choices, the pauses, the exclamations, and the introspection.


**9.1** **Phrases**

A phrase is a collection of words that function as one grammatical unit.


**Lovely Professional University** **81**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


**Types of Phrases**

_**Noun phrase**_

A noun phrase is a sentence that has a noun as its head. The head can be followed by modifiers—
elements that characterize or categorize whatever the head refers to—and can be preceded by
determiners like the, a, or her. Following are some examples of noun phrases:


        - At the zoo, I saw a striped zebra.

        - The spotted puppy is up for adoption.

_**Verb phrase**_

A verb phrase consists of a main verb and any auxiliary verbs. Following are the examples of verb
phrase:


        - I painted the fence (The verb phrase is a single main verb)

        - I was painting the fence. (The verb phrase is auxiliary verb ‘was’ and main verb is a

present participle)

_**Adjective phrase**_

Adjective phrases consist of a head (the adjective) and optional modifiers (which may come before
or after the adjective).Following are the examples of adjective phrase:


        - A person smarter than me needs to figure this out.

        - Everyone was extremely delighted when the winner was announced.

_**Adverb phrase**_

Adverb phrases have a similar structure to adjective phrases, but the head is an adverb.Following
are the examples of adverb phrase:


        - During the show, the baby slept. (gives relationship between show and slept-tells when)

        - The children ran on the playground. (gives relationship between children and

playground-tells where)

_**Prepositional phrase**_


Prepositional phrases mostly consist of a preposition (in bold below) followed by a noun phrase,
known as the prepositional complement. Following are the examples of prepositional phrase:


        - The book with the dog-eared pages was well-loved.

        - The largest present under the tree is yours.


**9.2** **Idioms**

A phrase or statement that deviates from the literal meaning of its words is known as an idiom.
Idioms, in other words, have a different meaning than individual words.

Below are few idiomatic expressions along with the meaning:

1. To play tricks on- to make someone the victim of a trick or a joke

They tried to play tricks on the professor.


2. To look after- to take care of

Grandma will look after the baby.


3. Once and for all- in a final manner

She said that he should stop telephoning her late at night, once and for all.


4. To come true- to prove to be correct

**9.3** **Punctuation Marks**

Punctuation: What Is It? Well, punctuation may be used to pause, ask a question, make a comment,
express excitement, and so on.

**List of punctuation marks**


        - Quotation Marks

        - Apostrophe

        - Hyphen

        - Ellipsis

        - Comma

        - Colon

        - Semicolon

        - Exclamation Mark/Exclamation Point

        - Question Mark

        - Full Stop/Period

_**Use of Quotation marks**_

Speech marks, sometimes known as quotation marks, are a type of punctuation used in English to
signify names, titles, and other things in addition to quoting a speaker's actual words. Quote marks
are described as "a pair of marks (' ') or ( " " ) put around a word, sentence, etc. to denote that it is
what someone said or wrote, that it is a title, or that you are using it in a unique way" by the Oxford
Learner's Dictionary. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, quotation marks are defined as “the
symbols “ ” or ‘ ’ that are put around a word or phrase to show that someone else has written or
said it”

Types of quotation marks with examples:

There are two types of quotation marks:


        - Single quotation marks


**84** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 09: Using Phrases, Idioms and Punctuation Appropriately**_


Single quotation marks, often known as "inverted commas," are typically used to cite

names, book and movie titles, character names, and other words that are given greater

significance than usual. Following are some examples:

We finally found ‘the coat’.

(In the above example, ‘the coat’ is placed within single quotation marks as it specifically refers to a
particular coat that they should have been looking for a long time)


Our English teacher asked us to read ‘The Importance of Being Earnest’ before Friday.


  - Double quotation marks

When quoting someone directly, as in direct speech, double quotation marks are typically

used. Additionally, you may use them to refer anything that was written or uttered by

another author or person. Following are some examples:

“I had a dream”, said Martin Luther King. Likewise, I do too.

(In the above sentence, you will see that “I had a dream” is a particular citation and so placed
within double quotation marks)

Nick said, “I enjoy watching musicals.”

This sentence quotes the exact words of Nick; therefore, they are placed within double quotation
marks.

_**Use of Apostrophe**_

This is used to show possession and for contraction of the word.Academic writing should avoid
contractions, yet all forms of writing utilise possessive apostrophes. Make sure to utilise them
properly, especially when working with abbreviations and plurals. Following are some examples:

**With singular nouns:**


  - The Prince’s role was not that essential.

  - Dorsi’s new hair cut was amazing.

  - I highly recommend Shoaib’s salon.


**With plural nouns:**


  - My parents’ support was necessary.

  - The two species’ habitats are very different.

  - The boys’ hostel is very untidy.


**With abbreviations and acronyms:**


  - In the third quarter, BP’s profit plunged.

  - AMD’s history is complex and debatable.


**Contractions:** To make a word or phrase shorter, one or more letters may occasionally be deleted.
When a letter is missing, an apostrophe is used to denote it.

For example,

It is – it’s

He is –he’s

I am – I ‘m


**Lovely Professional University** **85**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


However, contractions are informal, so should rarely be used in academic writing.


_**Hyphen**_

You must first learn what hyphens are in order to utilise them correctly. A hyphen (-) is a joiner that
is used in punctuation. It is employed to connect two distinct words. Although hyphens may follow
some prefixes, their primary function is to join compound words.


The hyphen can be used to:


        - link compound nouns (e.g., mother-in-law, runner-up, great-grandmother)

        - link compound adjectives (e.g., “air-tight” seal, “narrow-minded” man, “old-fashioned”

lady)

        - link prefix to a word (e.g., re-write, re-examine, ex-wife)


**A hyphen indicates that the combined word is one whole. It strives to remove obscurity.**

**Compound nouns**

A single noun made up of two words is called a compound noun.

Nouns are joined with phrasal verbs or adjectives to form compound nouns. Although they are
often formed by connecting phrasal verbs, they do not necessarily require a hyphen. Instead, you
may either use one or make them into a single word.

For instance


        - He received a go-ahead from the professor.

        - He sneaked-in last night.


**Compound Adjectives**

A compound adjective is made up of two words that operate together to modify a noun, just as
compound nouns. When a compound adjective is used before a noun, a hyphen is required.

For instance;


        - She adopted a four-year-old boy.

        - It was red-eyed monster.


**Prefix**

In order to modify a word's meaning, prefixes like "im-possible" and "un-able" are put before the
word. There is no set of guidelines that tells us whether or not to use a hyphen to connect a prefix to
a term.

For example- Pre -19 [th] century, Inter-bank


_**Ellipsis**_

An ellipsis (plural: ellipses) is a punctuation mark consisting of three dots.

When leaving off a word, phrase, line, paragraph, or more from a piece that is being quoted, use an
ellipsis. Ellipses eliminate or conserve space by omitting less important information. They help you
get to the point quickly and without diversion:

Although there are several methods to employ ellipses, the three-dot technique is the simplest.
Numerous strategies are employed by both fiction and nonfiction books, journals, and newspapers
that they consider appropriate.

_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


**Following introductory phrase or a word**

If we use a word, phrase, or dependent clause to introduce a sentence, we follow the introduction
with a comma:

For example,


        - Luckily, I reached on time.

        - Unfortunately, I missed the bus.


**Quotes**

A comma is used to introduce a quote:

She asked **,** “What are you doing?”

If a quote is not at the end of a sentence and doesn’t end in a question mark or exclamation
point,we typically follow the last word with a comma:

“I was not present here yesterday **,** ” the client said.


**Direct address**

We use commas to separate entities when referring to them specifically.

For example,

Steven **,** I found your red pencil.

**Interrupting phrases**

For example

That girl over there is **,** trust me on this **,** someone you should not bother.

_**Colon**_

A colon is a type of punctuation that separates sentences. The colon looks like two vertically
arranged dots (:). There are several uses for the colon, some of which include beginning a list,
beginning an explanation, beginning a quote, and beginning a connection between two connected
lines.

The following sentences show just some of the ways we can use a colon in a sentence.


        - Sasha owns three dogs **:** a beagle, a Dalmatian, and a husky.

        - Benjamin Franklin said my favorite quote **:** “There was never a good war or a bad peace.”

        - I stopped to consider an important question **:** Did I turn the faucet off?

Where to use colon?


**1.** **Introducing additional information**

A colon is frequently used to introduce information that is relevant to the phrase that came before
it. The colon is frequently used to distinguish a word or phrase, give it importance, or draw
attention to it. This specific information could consist of:


        - **A list:** I need various things from the store **:** milk, bread and fruits.

        - **A noun or noun phrase:** The weapon to defeat the lion was something nobody

expected **:** love.

        - **A quote:** My dad told me something I will never forget **:** “Capsicum on pizza is an

abomination.”

**2.** **Connecting two related information**


**88** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 09: Using Phrases, Idioms and Punctuation Appropriately**_


You can join two separate sentences using a colon. When the second statement clarifies or

explains the preceding sentence, a colon is typically used. For instance,

  - Me and my sisters are really overwhelmed **:** We’re going to Wonderland!

We can observe from the aforementioned sample how closely connected the first and

second sentences are. Instead of a comma, we may have used a period to make the

sentences seem longer and lose the connection.

_**Semi colon**_

The colon's quirky sibling is the semicolon. The semicolon is a dot that sits above a comma, whereas
the colon is just two dots piled on top of each other;


Other punctuation marks provide functions that the semicolon also does, although it does so in its
own unique way. It can divide items in a series like a comma. It frequently signifies the conclusion
of a whole phrase like a period or colon (that is, a sentence part that has its own subject and verb).
Additionally, it functions as a colon, indicating that what comes after it is directly tied to what came
before.


**1.** **Joining conjunctions:** Two clauses can be joined together in a single sentence using a

semicolon. A semicolon can be used to separate two independent ideas. Just make sure the

two clauses can function independently as two full sentences with proper grammar.

Here, a semicolon might take the place of a period. The two sentences are maintained as a single
unit, though, by using a semicolon in place of a period. Here is an example of this type of
semicolon use:


  - My job interview is today; I hope I do well

**2.** **Separate a series:** Semicolons can also be used to add distinction and clear up any ambiguity

within a succession of elements. In most circumstances, separating items in a series would

just require the use of a comma. You can use semicolons for clarification if the items include

sentences separated by commas. For instance,

  - This fruit salad includes juicy, ripe peaches; crisp, red apples; and pitted red and Rainier

cherries.

_**Exclamation mark**_

An exclamation point often denotes a strong emotion, such surprise, rage, or delight. Exclamation
points are similar to yelling or raising your voice when speaking when used in writing. The most
frequent usage of exclamation points in written speech quotations. Exclamation points should only
be used in professional writing when absolutely required.


**1.** **Use an exclamation mark to indicate strong feelings or a raised voice in speech:**

She shouted at him, "Go away! I hate you!"

He exclaimed: "What a fantastic house you have!”


**2.** **Many interjections require this mark:**

"Hi! What's new?"

"Oh! When are you going?"

**3. A non-question sentence beginning with "what" or "how" is often an exclamation and requires**
**an exclamation mark:**

What idiots we are! (We are such idiots.)

_**Question mark**_

Although it may be employed in a variety of ways, the question mark is an intriguing grammatical
construction that is most frequently found at the conclusion of direct queries. You might be unsure


**Lovely Professional University** **89**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


about how to properly utilise question marks while writing letters or submitting academic papers.
Here is a quick start guide to assist you.


When posing direct queries, such as those in the examples below, use question marks. For example,


        - How are you?

        - Where can I find a bargain on a good laptop?

_**Full stop/period**_

The full stop (.), commonly known as a "period," is used to signify the conclusion of an imperative
or declarative phrase. It essentially denotes a longer pause than that made by a comma and is also
used to imply that there is no further to be said about a subject, as in "I like playing football."
Through repetition, it is simple to remember when to use a full stop.


**1.** **At the end of the sentence:**

For example: My name is Ajay and I am a doctor.

**2.** **After initials:**

For example: U.S.A, U.K

**3.** **After abbreviations:**

For example: B.B.C

**4.** **At the end of indirect questions:**

For example: ‘He asked me why I missed the concert.’

**Keywords**


      - Metaphorical: figurative

      - Astounding: surprising

      - Neologisms: new expression, new term

      - Introspection: the examination or observation of one's own mental and emotional processes:

 - Comprehend what communication is.

 - Be able to define communication.

 - Have a basic understanding of the communication process.

 - Be able to explain how various elements impact communication.


**Introduction**

_**Communication can be defined as a process in which the ideas, thoughts,**_ _**information,**_
_**and multiple commands or requests are shared with others. The process highly focuses on**_
_**the transmission as well as the understanding of the message with confirmation in form**_
_**of feedback.**_

“Communication is a way that one organization member shares meaning and understanding with
another.” -Koontz and O’Donnell

(2) “Communication is the process of passing information and understanding from one person to
another.” -Keith Davis

(3) “Communication is the sum of the things one person does when he wants to create
understanding in the mind of another. It is a bridge of meaning. It involves a systematic and
continuous process of telling, listening and understanding.” Louis A. Allen


**10.1** **Features of Communication**


**A.** Communication is integral part of human life. From directing to requesting, no existence is

possible without it.

B. It is a continuous process. Since birth till death, in one or the other form, communication takes

place every minute.

C. Communication is commonly a two way process even when it is in form of intra- personal

interaction. One acts and the other reacts. One shares and the other reverts.

_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_

D. Communication is a rational process which serves a purpose every time it is used. Sometimes,

the motive could be sharing the information or other times, it could be for passing the time as

well.

E. The process of communication generally requires two participants where one is the sender of

the message and the other is the receiver. If one is missing then no inter- personal

communication can take place.


**10.2** **Types of Communication**

There are different types of Communication and each type is underlined by principles:

A) Verbal communication is the type in which a language and its symbols are utilized so that

one could transmit his ideas or thoughts to others. This kind of communication requires a
common language between both the sender and the receiver. By following the process of
communication, one sends the message to the other and the other reverts to the first
creating a chain of communication. This can further be divided into two sub- categories:

i) Written communication is where the interaction takes place in black and white on paper or in

ink. Here the sender of the message uses the language in written form to communicate
with the receiver. A fine example is sending a message to a friend on social media. Earlier
people used to write letters to each other. In present scenario, communication in form of
emails, articles etc.

ii) Oral or spoken communication is where the language is utilized in vocal manner. The sender of
the message prefers his voice as a medium of interaction. This type happens when people interact
face to face, or telephonically. As an example, we can focus on the scene where one is in
conversation with a friend or someone sitting next to him or when you receive a call from anyone
known and you share your heart and mind with the person.

B) Non-Verbal communication is the type in which the speaker or the sender of the message

delivers a part of the message through gestures, movements or bodily expressions. Things
like how one stands, sits, moves, shakes hand, his hand movements, his clothing, his sense
of personal space and all such things come under the category of non- verbal
communication. Without saying much, one can deliver a lot to the others through his body
and expressions.

Example is how a mother understands whether the child is in good or bad mood; if he is irritated or
happy; whether he has done something wrong or not; if he is lying or not, all these things are
clearly comprehended through multiple gestures and body movements indicating a certain specific
behavior corresponding various messages in form of indicators to the mother.

Following are the types counted under non- verbal communication

i) Proxemics which is basically one’s concept of personal space. It depends on the person how

wide his personal space criterion is and whom he feels comfortable with if someone enters
that space.

ii) Facial expressions depicting the feelings and emotions one is in.

iii) Paralinguistics which underlines the message through changes in the tone, pitch, inflection

and volume.

iv) Gestures are the signals to correspond and are generated through the body parts like a

“thumbs up” to show appreciation.

v) Haptics is the language of touch. With one touch, many messages could be conveyed.

vi) Artifacts are the accessories which mark the personality of the user and conveys a lot about

the person.

Next two types are more on the basis of the fact that in which kind of surroundings and what type
of people the language is used in and with:

C) Formal Communication is the one which is opted for when one is in organizational

structure i.e. the person is in his professional life and is communicating with people
related to his job profile. In such communication, it becomes mandatory for the person to
take care of multiple factors like:


**Lovely Professional University** **95**


_**Unit 10: Introduction to Communication – Principles and Process**_

i) If the receiver is a senior, a junior or a colleague

ii) If the receiver is a client

iii) If the receiver is a male or female

iv) If the receiver is taking or giving advice

v) If the receiver is reporting or being reported to

vi) If the communication is taking place in the cabin or board room ( the surroundings and the
number of people present)

vii) Timings of the communication

viii) Channel for the communication.

This type is further sub- divided:

 - Downward communication in which the flow of correspondence begins from the higher
authorities moving towards the subordinates like the principal issues a circular and that is
subjected to the vice- principal to share with the faculty members to ensure it reaches the
target that is the students:

Principal

↓

Vice- Principal

↓

Teacher

↓

Student


 - Upward communication is where the communication initiates from the most sub-ordinate

strata leading to the highest. When subordinates submit report to their seniors, provide

feedback or give suggestions. In the following flow chart, one can observe how it works. A

student writes an application for leave and hands it over to his teacher who takes that to the

vice- principal who further sends it to the principal for the approval:

Principal

↑

Vice- Principal

Teacher

 - Horizontal communication which occurs at the level of equivalence like colleagues, HODs of

different departments. When the manager from purchase departments gets involved in

communication with the manager from the sales department for information:

Manger (Purchase) → Manager ( Sales )

D) Informal communication is the type which one uses regularly with everyone who is either

from his personal life or is of his level like colleagues. The restrictions and considerations
are far less in comparison to the formal style. One is free and has a flexible approach as not
much of rules are required to be followed. In common life on day- to- day basis, one gets
involved in this type of communication. It is impossible for human nature to survive
without generating personal connections so interacting with the people you work with or
you live around is a must. The major sub- type of Informal communication is “Grapevine”
which exists even in the most organized enterprises.

Grapevine is a gossip monger model in which one relies on ideas shared without authentic proof.
In simple language, it could be called ‘gossip’ at work place’. It begins in form of a rumor and if not
checked at right time, it could be highly persuading turning a truth into a lie. Such type of unmonitored communication can lead to disasters but is healthy too if practiced in a controlled
manner as it keeps the curiosity and zeal alive in monotonous work place.


The above model represents how gossip spreads in an organization, One can assume that ‘A’
received a tip that a new boss is about to join. He shares the information with his trustworthy
colleagues ‘B’ and ‘G’. Once they receive the information, they show their trust in other people like
‘A’ showed in them. As a result, everyone who receives the rumor shares it further becoming the
part of that gossip thread or grapevine. After some time, it will be quite difficult to find the root of
that rumor.


**10.3** **Model of Communication Process**

Communication process could occur in two ways. One is “One-way” and the other is “Two-way”.

A. In “One-way or Linear model”, the communication sequence is:

Sender of the message------> encodes------>channel to share the idea----->Receiver------>decodes.

Such sequence is used in communication like for mass where we have one sender and a huge
number of receivers. When a TV News anchor relays breaking news, it is Linear model of
communication as he is sending the message to ‘n’ number of receivers without the knowledge of
exact amount of the recipients. In such communication, chances of feedback from the receivers is
almost negligible as it is difficult to mark every receiver individually.

B. In “Two-way or Interactional model”, the communication sequence is:

Sender has an idea------> encodes------>channel to share the idea----->Receiver------>decodes

Receiver encodes----> channel to send the feedback-----> Sender receives the feedback---->decodes.

Such sequence is used in communication is commonly used in most of the types of inter-and intra communication.

When a sender thinks of sharing his idea


1. First he needs to be clear in his thoughts,

2. Then he encodes the idea in a particular language

3. Chooses the channel to transmit

4. Message is sent

5. The receiver receives the message

6. Decodes it as per his knowledge of the language and understanding of the text.

7. The receiver becomes the sender and using the same sequence of encoding, channelizing

sends the feedback.

8. The earlier sender becomes the receiver now and follows the steps of decoding and reverting.

**Message** is an idea or a piece of information that a person wants to share with rest of the world or
another person. He thinks and ensures to himself that he wants to transmit the same to others and
for that he needs to convert the thought into language.

**Encoding** is a proper process in which the user transforms his thoughts or ideas into words with
conscious selection of correct type of vocabulary and sentence construction as per the level of the
receiver of that message.

**Channel** is the medium through which the sender and the receiver communicate. It is the selection
whether to indulge in communication in writing or speaking.

**Introduction**

There are many ways to facilitate effective communication. How you use your words, body
language, tone of voice, and visual cues determine how you are understood. Verbal and nonverbal
communication skills work in tandem to deliver an understandable message. Verbal
communication is interpersonal communication that includes oral communication, written
communication, and sign language. Verbal communication relies on words to convey meaning
between two or more people.Nonverbal communication encompasses a whole host of physicalized
nonverbal cues that convey emotional states and complement verbal messages.

Nonverbal human communication involves many different parts of the body and can be either
conscious or subconscious on the part of the communicator.


**11.1** **Communication**

While nonverbal communication involves body language, verbal communication relies on words.
There’s more to it than that, however. Proper communication often requires a mix of verbal and
nonverbal signals to convey meaning.


**Forms Of Communication** :


- **Delivery** : Verbal communication can transpire over the phone, through email, written letters, or
a face-to-face conversation. Most nonverbal communication happens only when the two or
more parties can see each other.

- **Intentionality** : A difference between the two types of communication, verbal and nonverbal, is
that the words a person chooses—verbal—tend to be intentional, whereas many elements of
nonverbal communication can be unintentional or out of a person’s control and impact


**Lovely Professional University** **105**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


reception. Nonverbal communication can be unconscious; for example, a person who sweats
while talking may convey nervousness.

     - **Grammar** : Verbal speech has patterns and grammar rules to adhere to, whereas nonverbal
communication is more fluid.

     - **Authenticity** : Nonverbal behavior like body movements, mannerisms, or physiological
responses (blinking or fidgeting) can influence communication, altering the authenticity of your
spoken words or causing them to take on a different meaning. Nonverbal messages can be more
powerful than verbal communication, as human bodies can subconsciously deliver messages
that they are verbally not conveying—“actions speak louder than words.”

     - **Emotions** : Nonverbal cues are especially powerful when communicating with children. A
parent’s facial expressions and tone will often express feelings more clearly than using words
kids may be too young to understand fully. Nonverbal communication is also beneficial when
communicating emotions between a language barrier.

     - **Engagement** : Nonverbal signals are a great way to communicate attentiveness and engagement
to those around you. It’s not enough to verbally tell someone you are interested in what they’re
saying, controlling your posture and eye contact will demonstrate to others that you are
interested, whereas looking around or at your phone can express disinterest, even if that’s not
technically the case.


**What Is Verbal Communication?**

Verbal communication is interpersonal communication that includes oral communication, written
communication, and sign language. Verbal communication relies on words to convey meaning
between two or more people.

**Communication** is the process of sending and receiving messages through verbal and nonverbal
means including speech or oral communication, writing or written communication, signs, signals,
and behavior.


**Importance of Communication**

**Communication** is **the process by which an individual conveys information to another person**
**through behaviors, words, or sounds** . One person, the sender, sends a message containing
information, while another person, the receiver, receives the message. One sender can channel the
message to multiple receivers by using mass media or social media. The channel is the method the
sender uses to transmit the message to the receivers. This can be done through visual or audio
channels. Two people who receive the same message may interpret the information differently due
to each person's background, experience, and culture, as well as elements in the communication
process such as noise or interference which may or may not affect the transmission of the message.

Communication is important because it serves as the basis for a society. This transfer and exchange
of information allow people to function smoothly within a society and understand one another.
Transmitting meaningful concepts from person to person sets humans apart from the rest of the
animal kingdom where effective communication is essential to humanity. While communication is
essential and natural in practice, effective communication can be a complex skill to develop.


**Types of Communication**

       - Verbal Communication

       - Nonverbal Communication

This lesson will focus on verbal and nonverbal communication and its features and applications.


**Verbal Communication Definition**

What is verbal communication? What is the purpose of verbal communication? The definition
of **verbal communication** is **the transmission of information from one person to another orally**
**through words and sounds** . This is seen when an individual speaks in a conversation with another
individual. Words are sounds that have an intentional meaning within a conversation. This can be


**106** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 11: Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication**_


in person or through electronic devices, such as telecommunication. The purpose of verbal
communication is to communicate a message through the use of words and sounds, providing
contextual clarity to a message geared toward a receiver. The sender, or communicator, should be
focused on their message, including the overall clarity, when to start a conversation, staying
focused while in a conversation to maximize the communicative exchange, as well as determining
the correct timing in speaking appropriately. Refraining from interrupting or interjecting in a
conversation that does not fluidly lead into the topic can enhance a communicative exchange of
verbal communication.


**Examples of verbal communication are:**

  - **Tone** : An indication of the purpose of communication such as serious or humorous.

  - **Pitch** : The sound of one's voice which could be high or low pitch.

  - **Speed** : Speaking fast or speaking slowly within conversations.

  - **Volume** : The level of sound that one speaks at (for example could be loud, or low).

  - **Clarity** : The way words are spoken and if they are separated from each other or could be
blended or mumbled together.

  - **Pace** : The overall rate at which someone speaks which could be an even or uneven tempo.

The best way to understand verbal communication is by the use of examples. The following is an
example of verbal communication:


  - Janelle calls the doctor to get some clarification on a prescription that was written. She states
her name clearly, and purpose for calling. She is sure to use proper medical terminology that
suits her audience, the doctor. She speaks slowly and loudly so the doctor can hear her.

  - The doctor reads back the order to her slowly, annunciating every word. He states: "I am
prescribing Clonazepam 0.5 mg for anxiety to Sarah Mcgraham to be taken at 10:00 AM."

  - Janelle repeats back the order by stating: "Clonazepam 0.5 mg for anxiety to Sarah
Mcgraham to be taken at 10:00 AM."

  - The doctor confirms and they end their call.

This is an effective example of verbal communication because Janelle and the doctor spoke slowly,
clearly, and checked for understanding with each other. This method of speaking with the proper
speed, pace, tone, volume, pitch, and clarity ensured that their message was being decoded
accurately by the other person involved in the transfer of information while minimizing any
elements of interference or noise, especially while using a channel of telecommunication. Likewise,
both Janelle and the doctor were focused to the point of the purpose of the communication
exchange, and also each maintained appropriate timing in not interrupting each other to maintain
patience in the exchange. Verbal communication can be unsuccessful if the basic elements are not
considered when the sender and receiver are channeling the message to each other.

**Nonverbal Communication Definition**

What is nonverbal communication? The definition of **nonverbal communication** is **how a message**
**is communicated or sent without oral** **communication** . Most communication occurs through
nonverbal communication, sometimes providing context to verbal communication while at most
other times being an indicator of messages on its own.

The transmitter of a message sends nonverbal cues to the receiver, even when the message behind
nonverbal communication is intentional or unintentional. These cues contain signals to how the
person truly feels and the intention of the message being communicated. Nonverbal
communication can signal to the receiver or unintended receivers different emotions, feelings, and
reactions such as when the communicator is lying, being sarcastic, or being genuine.

Examples of nonverbal communication include:

       - Speeches

       - Conversations

       - TV shows

       - Radio shows

       - Oral interviews


**What is nonverbal communication examples?**

Nonverbal communication is how a person communicates in a conversation without using words
or sounds. Examples of nonverbal communication include:

       - Eye contact

       - Posture

       - Touch

       - Space

       - Gestures

       - Body Movement

       - **Facial Expressions**


What is verbal communication and nonverbal communication?

The definition of verbal communication is the transmission of information from one person to
another orally through words and sounds. The definition of nonverbal communication is how a
person communicates without oral communication. Most communication is through nonverbal
communication.


**11.2** **Types Of Communication**

Humans do not just utilize one way of communicating. They adopt various methods through
which communication occurs. There are three broad types of communication.

       - Verbal communication: In this type of communication, words are employed to transmit
ideas or information. This can be done in the form of verbal interactions or through


**108** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_



_**Unit 11: Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication**_


written or text messages such as letters, e-mails, telegrams, SMS and other contemporary
modes of transmission.

  - Non-verbal communication: This type of communication takes place through a medium
other than words.

  - Non-verbal communication involves body language and gestures such as eye contact,
nodding, hand gestures, posture etc. to transfer any message.

  - Visual communication: This is yet another type of communication that adopts visual
graphics to convey the desired message. For example, pictures, presentations, info
graphics


**Verbal communication and its types**

As mentioned above, verbal communication is the method of sending and receiving information
using words as the mode of transmission. This can be done by either engaging in verbal
conversations or by sending written messages. For example, Gerald wanted to convey to his boss
that he would be taking a day off from work as he has his doctor’s appointment. He chose to send
the message via e-mail as that would be considered more professional rather than making a call
regarding the same.

The method of verbal communication can also be classified into **different types and they are** :

  - Intrapersonal communication

  - Interpersonal communication

  - Small group communication

  - Public communication

  - Mass communication


**What are the advantages and dis-advantages of verbal communication?**

**Advantages:**

  - It is the most convenient mode of communicating information.

  - It helps in conveying messages with clarity and precision.

  - It is the most confidential medium of interaction.

  - Verbal communication helps in easier comprehension.

  - Instant feedback can be received.


**Disadvantages:**


**Lovely Professional University** **109**


_**Notes**_



_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


      - Verbal communication holds no proof of the conversation held unless it is recorded.

      - Emotions during the conversation can twist the intended meaning of the message.

      - Verbal communication can get lengthy and hence distort the purpose of the conversation.

      - The messages sent across can be misinterpreted.

      - In verbal communication, there is no going back. Everything is said and done and the
person has to live with the consequences of the words spilt.

Verbal and nonverbal communication skills work in tandem to deliver an understandable
message. Verbal communication is interpersonal communication that includes oral
communication, written communication, and sign language. Verbal communication relies on
words to convey meaning between two or more people.Nonverbal communication encompasses
a whole host of physicalized nonverbal cues that convey emotional states and complement
verbal messages.

Nonverbal human communication involves many different parts of the body and can be either
conscious or subconscious on the part of the communicator.

 - Advice: Something you may be doing out of principle or belief could be a barrier to others

without you realizing it. Consider how to work around it.

1. Woman #2 invites Woman #1 to type into the device so they can communicate. Just then

the train passes by and the device only records a blurred sound.

 - TOOL DOESN’T WORK IN NOISY ENVIRONMENTS – BARRIER IS ENVIRONMENTAL.

 - Advice: Consider the environment for communication and make adjustments where possible

to improve communication options (ie. Move to a quieter place?)

2. They try again – but the device is out of power

 - SYSTEM PROBLEM.

 - Advice: Before starting your day, check your systems and devices so they can sustain you

throughout the journey.

 - Woman #1 tries to show Woman #2 where she wants to go on the subway map, but Woman

#1 is simply too short to reach it.

 - ENVIRONMENTAL/PHYSICAL BARRIER.

 - Advice: When you notice something is not working with a system, consider how it could be

modified to be more accessible.

 - The two women use hand gestures to communicate, and Woman #1 is able to explain using

gestures that she wants to go to Happy Valley.

 - _USE NON-VERBAL TECHNIQUES LIKE GESTURES AND SIGNALS._

Be flexible in your communication with others. If one method doesn’t work, try something
different. Consider the role of non-verbal communication.


9. It turns out that both women are going to Happy Valley. When Woman #2 shows her

ticket, both women shake hands because they have just solved the problem.

 - WHEN COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE, NOTICE THE

ACCOMPLISHMENT.

 - Advice: Taking a small moment to acknowledge that your communication efforts have

achieved a desirable outcome can help you form a more positive overall view of

communication AND of the people you have been communicating with.

Just then the train both women need to take leaves without them.


 - SYSTEM BARRIER.

Advice: Irony exists. Just because a solution seems to have been found, that solution may not be an
effective one. Avoid disappointment by realizing that if one solution does not work out, another
will come that will work out, it just hasn’t come yet.


11. Woman #2 becomes frustrated and angry. Woman #1 feels bad about it.

 - ATTITUDINAL BARRIER.

 - Advice: Helping others may not always be beneficial to you. That isn’t their problem and

blaming others for your lack of benefit doesn’t help either of you. Get over it and move on!

As if to add more stress to the situation, an announcement on the subway speaker says, “Line four
is delayed for one hour.”


 - SYSTEM DESIGN/ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIER.

 - Advice: Chalk it up to your tuition fee for a life lesson on patience. Move on.

**Introduction**

The term _communicative_ _competence_ refers to both the tacit knowledge of a language and the ability
to use it effectively. It's also called _communication competence_, and it's the key to social acceptance.

The concept of communicative competence (a term coined by linguist Dell Hymes in 1972) grew out
of resistance to the concept of linguistic competence introduced by Noam Chomsky. Most scholars
now consider linguistic competence to be a part of communicative competence.

Communicative competence (CC), a term in the Second Language Acquisition language (L2) is an
expected part of their daily lives. social tasks with efficacy and fluency through extended
interactions. This definition is a synthesis of positions noted below in the research literature since
the 1960s

Communicative competence (CC), a term in the Second Language Acquisition (SLA) literature with
an evolving definition over the last fifty years, and its successive notion, interactional competence
(IC), must guide the curricular choices second-language teachers make as they seek to help their
students successfully navigate scenarios where interaction in the second language (L2) is an
expected part of their daily lives.


**122** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


**13.1** **Components**

**There are 4 components of COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE**

**(i)** **Grammatical competence**

includes knowledge of phonology, orthography, vocabulary, word formation and sentence
formation.

**(ii)Sociolinguistic competence**

includes knowledge of socio-cultural rules of use. It is concerned with the learners' ability to handle
for example settings, topics and communicative functions in different sociolinguistic contexts. In
addition, it deals with the use of appropriate grammatical forms for different communicative
functions in different sociolinguistic contexts.


**(iii)** **Discourse competence**

is related to the learners' mastery of understanding and producing texts in the modes of listening,
speaking, reading and writing. It deals with cohesion and coherence in different types of texts.

**(iv)** **Strategic competence**

refers to compensatory strategies in case of grammatical or sociolinguistic or discourse difficulties,
such as the use of reference sources, grammatical and lexical paraphrase, requests for repetition,
clarification, slower speech, or problems in addressing strangers when unsure of their social status
or in finding the right cohesion devices. It is also concerned with such performance factors as
coping with the nuisance of background noise or using gap fillers.

**Communicative Competence  2**

An immigrant moves to a new country, a student of any age enters a second or foreign language
classroom, and a business person meets a colleague from around the world for the first time. These
three scenarios present possible situations where one’s first language skills are insufficient to
achieve self- or other-imposed expectations of interactions with speakers of another language.
Communicative competence (CC), a term in the Second Language Acquisition (SLA) literature with
an evolving definition over the last fifty years, and its successive notion, interactional competence
(IC), must guide the curricular choices second-language teachers make as they seek to help their
students successfully navigate scenarios where interaction in the second language (L2) is an
expected part of their daily lives.


**13.2** **Origin and Definition**

Communicative competence can be defined as the ability to use language, or to communicate, in a
culturally appropriate manner in order to make meaning and accomplish social tasks with efficacy
and fluency through extended interactions. This definition is a synthesis of positions noted below
in the research literature since the 1960s. The following paragraphs point to the origins of CC and
will clarify the basis of each part of the definition put forward.

**Initial Origin**

In one of the first discussions in the literature about competence, Chomsky (1965)
distinguishesbetween “competence (the speaker-hearer’s knowledge of his language) and
performance (the actual use of language in concrete situations) [emphasis in original]” (p. 4).
According to Chomsky (1965), deviations from the ideal in actual performance do not reflect
competence: “A grammar of a language purports to be a description of the ideal speakerCOMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE


**Subsequent Development**

The literature begins to position CC in SLA contexts with the intent of providing a framework for
developing second language course syllabi. Canale and Swain (1980) specifically address CC’s
definition and development in an article focused on second language teaching.Canale and Swain
(1980) use CC “to refer to the relationship and interaction between grammatical competence…and
sociolinguistic competence” (p. 6). This mirrors Hymes’ (1972) claim that grammar rules are
incomplete without rules of use. Canale and Swain’s (1980) purpose in asserting this definition is to


**Lovely Professional University** **123**


_**Unit 13: Communicative Competence**_


provide guidelines for how to develop communicative COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 5
course syllabi, namely that grammar and sociolinguistics features must both be included in second
language coursework and both must be assessed, as well. This is in sharp contrast to the grammarcentered syllabi found in most coursework by Canale and Swain (1980).

Savignon (1991) also mentions a divergence between more grammar-based and notional-functional
syllabi. Savignon (1991) recounts the European development as being “derived from neo-Firthian
systemic or functional linguistics that views language as meaning potential and maintains the
centrality of context of situation” (p. 263). Notional-functional syllabi have been needs for
communication rather than on a stratified sequence of grammatical structures that grow
increasingly more difficult. At the same time, developments in the United States have centered on
Hymes’ reaction to Chomsky’s theories.


In developing her own definition and application of CC, Savignon (2002) mentions that Hymes uses
CC “to represent the ability to use language in a social context, to observe sociolinguistic norms of
appropriateness” (p. 2) and maintains that “Hymes’ focus was not language learning but language
as social behavior [emphasis in original]” (p. 2). Savignon interact with other speakers, to make
meaning, as distinct from their ability to recite dialogues or perform on discrete-point tests of
grammatical knowledge” (p. 3). Therefore, Savignon’s paradigm focuses on what a second
language learner can do with the language in authentic settings, not just on the ability to memorize
chunks of language for artificial, planned experiences.


Not only does CC include the ability to make meaning in authentic contexts, it also includes an
assumption of facility. In his study of interlanguage analysis, Pallotti (2010) COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 6 distinguishes between CC and linguistic competence, but he also indicates that
CC is “further divided into efficacy (the ability to reach one’s communicative goals) and fluency
(the ability to do so smoothly, quickly and effortlessly)” (p. 173). Pallotti’s definition, including
fluency with its describing adverbs of “smoothly, quickly, and effortlessly” seems to shift the focus
from merely being able to negotiate meaning—regardless of the accompanying false starts and
halted language—to a concept where the negotiation of language happens with a great deal of
automaticity.

One further extension development to the concept of CC is that it occurs in an interactive process.
Hall and Pekarek Doehler (2011) extend the notion of CC to IC in this way: “Central to competent
engagement in our interactions is our ability to accomplish meaningful social actions, to respond to
c-participants’ [sic] previous actions and to make recognizable for others what our actions are and
how these relate to their own actions” (p. 1). L2 speakers demonstrate IC when they make
appropriate use of language in extended, turn-taking. They understand, according to a situational
specific socio-cultural context, the intent of the language moves made by the other interlocutors in
the setting, and the L2 speakers know how, again according to that same context, to make further
language moves such that their communicative output will be taken up in the manner that the L2
speakers intend.


**Synthesized Definition**

To restate the initial claimed definition, CC can be defined as the ability to use language, or to
communicate, in a culturally appropriate manner in order to make meaning and accomplish social
tasks with efficacy and fluency through extended interactions. This definition can be analyzed as
follows. First, L2 speakers must have the ability to use language itself, including the ability to form
grammatically possible and feasible locutions (Hymes, 1972). Second, L2 COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 7 speakers must demonstrate the inclusion of the socio-cultural component of
cultural appropriateness (Hymes, 1972; Canale & Swain, 1980). Third, L2 speakers must be able to
make meaning, not merely regurgitate memorized phrases or answer correctly on discrete
grammar point tests (Savignon, 2002). Fourth, L2 speakers must use language in ways that are
effective in accomplishing their desired tasks in a facile, almost unconscious manner (Palloti, 2010).
Finally, L2 speakers must be able to achieve these communicative tasks in social, extended
interactions wherein they have the skills and understanding to decode and encodemessages with
appropriate socio-cultural intent (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011). Through understanding these
components, second-language instructors can more clearly understand the intended goal or
outcome of their courses.

Necessity to Focus on Communicative Competence in Teaching“The role of the language teacher is
to help learners get along in real-life situations” (Savignon, 1997, p. 114). L2 speakers must be able


**124** **Lovely Professional University**



_**Notes**_


_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


to process and interact with the language they experience in order to succeed in the sociocultural
contexts in which they find themselves.

Whether in the classroom, the grocery store, or the workplace, if L2 speakers do not have access to
this language, they have less opportunity and less power to interact as equal members of social
interactions. CC as a goal, through various Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)
methodologies, allows L2 speakers the cultural and linguistic knowledge needed to handle the
interactional challenges presented to them.

When preparing to teach L2 speakers a second or foreign language, teachers must realize that
correct L2 grammar and denotative meanings are insufficient to prepare those L2 speakers for real
interactions in the target language. L2 speakers must understand the intent of communication,
embedded in specific cultural settings, in order to fully demonstrate CC COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 8 (Savignon, 1997). The following research discusses the value of CLT,
measurement of CC, the role of pragmatics within CLT, differing opinions within academia of the
value and purpose of language courses, critiques of applying CC theory to curriculum, difficulties
of implementing CLT, and the future of CLT.

Value of Communicative Language Teaching The tension between a focus on grammar and a focus
on communicating meaning has created an either/or mindset in language instruction. However,
putting these two foci in conflict is inaccurate: L2 speakers must not only make themselves
understood to native language speakers but also use correct grammar in the process (Canale &
Swain, 1980). Canale and Swain’s (1980) components of CC can be defined as follows:
“grammatical…knowledge of lexical items and rules of morphology, syntax, semantics and
phonology; sociolinguistic… knowledge of rules of language use; strategic…knowledge of
strategies to overcome communicative problems; and, discourse…knowledge needed to participate
in literacy activities” (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2001, p. 3). Savignon (1997) uses these four
components to develop a study comparing a CLT approach with a traditional grammar approach.
Students in the CLT group perform better on grammar assessments than students whose
instruction focuses solely on grammatical structures. Furthermore, students experiencing a CLT
approach are also able to communicate more easily in spontaneous communicative interactions
than do students who only experience traditional grammar teaching (Savignon, 1997). When L2
speakers experience pedagogical opportunities for communicative practice (using language
authentic contexts rather than isolated, grammar drills), their facility for more natural use develops.
Lightbown and Spada (2013) conclude that Savignon’s study “offers support for the hypothesis that
meaning-based instruction is advantageous, not that form-based instruction is not” (Chapter 6,
Section 1, para.


**13.3** **Communicative Competence**

While CLT does provide an opportunity for students to be creative in their use of language, it does
not have to exclude a focus on form. Teachers can help language learners acquire variations of
textbook language by appropriating a “sociocultural framework of pragmatics as mediated action”
(Van Compernolle, 2013, p. 358). In Van Compernolle’s (2013) study, the tu vs. vous formality
dichotomy helps students know when to use the pronouns on or nous and when to leave out or use
the negative particle ne. Students learn not just what the words mean, but what kind of attitude the
students will convey based on these language and grammatical choices. When teachers begin with
“meanings       - concepts       - that are important for learners to appropriate rather than forms or
structures” (Van Compernolle, 2013, p. 358), students begin to make situation-specific appropriate
use of formal and informal language markers without mediated support. This framework uses
dynamically administered scenarios to simultaneously assess students’ current competence with
expressing a concept while also guiding the students who are unable to perform independently.
While direct instruction, awareness-building, and noticing are useful in language study, they are
insufficient to lead to competence (Van Compernolle, 2013). Van Compernolle (2013) and Savignon
(1997) both demonstrate that focusing on meaning while also drawing attention to form can lead L2
speakers to CC, including appropriate grammar usage.

Measurement of Communicative Competence One aspect of teaching and learning for which
teachers are accountable is reporting progress that students make, often in a quantifiable form.
Several monographs address how to quantify CC (i.e., identify or label a CC level) in terms of the
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), including some discussions
considering the validity of comparing proficiency levels to CC (Bartning, Martin, & Vedder, 2010).
Teachers shouldCOMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 10 hesitate using a focus on errors for
assessing beginners’ proficiency levels; instead, teacher must understand the sophisticated

_**Unit 13: Communicative Competence**_


development of a learner’s interlanguage: “one should always bear in mind that…‘accuracy
growth’ and ‘interlanguage development’ do not represent the same construct” (Pallotti, 2010, p.
163). Teachers should also be careful to focus on the meaning and intent of proficiency level
descriptions rather than converting proficiency level to a numerical percentage (Pallotti, 2010).
Numerical scores may be easy to calculate, but they do not describe the nuances of language
development that teachers must consider as they develop lessons. Vocabulary growth can be used
as a diagnostic tool to determine proficiency level, such as found in the CEFR (Milton, 2010). L2
speakers’ word choices reveal how broadly and deeply they can interact with topics. Beginning
speakers will demonstrate word choices concerning very specific, personal experience topics while
advancing speakers will be demonstrate word choices about less immediate topics, as well. CC
growth can also be observed “both at the level of expanding one’s range of communicative
activities and at the level of performing them in increasingly more complex and sophisticated
ways” (Hulstihn, Alderson, and Schoonen, 2010, p.

12). In order for a student to fully develop his or her communicative competence, both breadth and
depth must take place in the classroom activities an L2 speaker experiences.

Role of Pragmatics in Communicative Language TeachingAs mentioned above, mastery of surface
level structures, understanding denotative word meanings and being able to construct
grammatically correct sentences, is insufficient for achieving CC. L2 speakers must be able to
navigate the sociocultural contexts in which they must actually use the language. For example, if a
child who forget to bring bread to the table, a parent, as an authority, might remark, “Where’s the
bread? Who set the table? I don’t see the bread” (Savignon, 1997, p. 19). The child is to infer that
an indirect command is being given COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 11 without the parent
using a grammatically imperative sentence. This understanding of nuance, of knowing the
meaning intended by the speaker within the specific context, goes much deeper than explanations
provided by dictionary definitions or grammar textbooks. Pragmatics creates a lens in which to
understand CC in real life situations where intentions and expectations of linguistic and behavioral
interactions are often left implicit.

Research in SLA often does not match practice in the classroom. Ishihara (2007) writes, “Although
pragmatic ability (the ability to use language effectively to achieve a specific purpose and
understand language in context) has been recognized as an essential component of communicative
competence…, pragmatics has not been fully incorporated into today’s second/foreign language
(L2) teaching and teacher education [emphasis in original]” (p. 21).

Lessons on why and when to use specific speech acts such as thanking or apologizing,
beyondsimply how to form the words for the speech act, help students to understand cultural
appropriateness better. Journaling allows students to compare their own cultural experiences with
the expectations of the new culture and creates a metapragmatic awareness in students that allows
them to process “the cultural ideologies underlying the L2 use” (Ishihara, 2007, p. 32) and helps
them to make choices of “how to express themselves through the L2” (Ishihara, 2007, p.

32). While students may be overwhelmed by the amount of information developed through a
lesson based on pragmatics, an explicit approach in which students are taught to use noticing
techniques may “[provide] an insider perspective of the target culture” (Ishihara, 2007, p. 32) often
lacking in formal language instruction.

Vásquez and Fioramente (2011) echo the importance of teaching pragmatics to students and are
concerned about the lack of pragmatics instruction within ESL master’s degree programs in the
United States. In their words, “to be a competent language user, an individual must have
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE  12 the ability to produce utterances which are grammatical
as well as appropriate to the context in which they are made, considering the participants, their
relationships, as well as the (often unstated but assumed) social rules for interaction” (Vásquez &
Fioramente, 2011, p. 1). Pragmatics within ESL instruction may be narrowed to the areas of speech
acts, language functions, and linguistic politeness, with explicit instruction needed in each area
(Vásquez & Fioramente, 2011). While ESL teachers may be prepared to help ELLs form language
structures (Hymes’ possibility and feasibility criteria), these teachers might not be prepared to
address Hymes’ appropriateness criterion in their curricula. Teachers may not have identified the
indirect language needed for appropriate interactions in the L2, taking this understanding for
granted. Assignments with real-world applications can help teachers and their students to
understand the implications of pragmatics and thus their importance (Vásquez& Fioramente, 2011).

Teachers may be reluctant to participate in voluntary professional development offerings focused
on pragmatics, even though the research clearly calls for it as part of CC and shows instruction in
pragmatics to be effective (Vellenga, 2011). Teachers may feel pragmatics are not as important as

teaching linguistic features or that there is no time in language courses to integrate pragmatics. In
Vellenga’s (2011) study, teachers are encouraged to use contrastive analysis with their students to
compare L1 and L2 approaches to speech acts such as greetings, requests, and refusals. Some
teachers, who use English-only methodologies, report feeling confused about asking students to
think about how these speech acts occur in the L1 but value this approach when they receive
appropriate training, nonetheless. One participant in Vellenga’s (2011) study specifically recognizes
the need for awareness building of American pragmatics for COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE
13 ESL teachers, as these teachers might take for granted American routines or expectations and not
know what items to help their students notice.

Zapata (2005) likens Ishihara’s insider perspective to Byram’s intercultural communicative
competence and Kramsch’s third place, “the intersection between the native and target cultures
where learners have a deep understanding of both” (Zapata, 2005, p. 261). Zapata’s study
demonstrates how comparison of native speaker experts’ analyses of a piece of literature with
university level L2 students’ analyses leads students to understand not just the language of the
story but also the cultural context in which it is written. The native speakers’ analyses consistently
articulate a religious theme, even though no religious ideas are mentioned in the story, but the L2
students do not address this theme. This comparison helps the L2 students to see how cultural
aspects frame the way in which native speakers interpret the language around them.


**Differing Opinions in Academia About Purpose and Content of Language Courses**

The literature presents several articles centered on a division among foreign language and second
language teachers between a focus on literature instruction and a focus on language instruction that
often takes the form of CLT. Rifkin (2006) points out a tendency within SLA pedagogies to focus
only on oral language and reiterates that the ACTFL Proficiency guidelines and the National
Standards for Foreign Language Learning do not give higher precedence to speaking over listening,
reading, and writing. Rifkin states that a dichotomy does not exist between “teaching toward
literacy” and “teaching for proficiency” (p. 263), using proficiency as a synonym for communicative
competence. Rifkin advocates, “The curriculum for communicative language instruction should
require the interpretation of written and spoken texts, including literary texts, in their cultural
context at the introductory and intermediate levels for all COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 14
languages…as preparation for ever greater and more sophisticated learning challenges at each step
of the curriculum” (p. 263). Likewise, Tucker (2006) states that CC’s “received understanding as a
unidirectional, primarily oral mode of functional meaning-making must give way to new
appreciations of dialogical communicative performance as a relational and collaborative act of
subjective negotiation” (p. 265).

Steinhart (2006) uses the terms CC and content to identify the two ideological camps, with language
(i.e. CC) being the focus of beginning and intermediate courses and content the focus of advanced
courses. According to Steinhart, language and content should be present in all courses, regardless
of the level. Elementary programs should have an interactive oral focus and to an extent secondary
programs should, as well. However, all programs should have a full-spectrum articulation goal
leading toward use of the language to learn content. Some teachers might be unwilling to teach
content using the L2 because the teachers themselves are unskilled in the areas of content to study,
due to the mostly oral approaches used in the teachers’ own language studies. Interweaving the
four language skills together can be difficult, especially at the university level where students of all
proficiency levels must quickly move toward advanced content work. Steinhart (2006) offers,
“Perhaps we should…consider how communicative competence might be addressed, spiraled, and
extended through the collegiate sequence of language study” (p. 260). In other words, the ability to
understand, create, and appropriately use language should be a part of all language coursework,
not just the beginning classes.

Students’ interactions today, with other students who have multi-national, multi-lingual, and
multi-cultural backgrounds, are very different from when CLT first developed in the 1970s
(Kramsch, 2006). At that time, most students’ interactions were with other monolingual students
who belonged to single ethnicities and cultures. Teachers must now think of students not as
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 15 future tourists but as future international workers. This
correlates with a shifted goal in second-language courses from an awareness and ability to parse
the L2 to an ability to use the L2 in authentic contexts. Therefore, teachers must “view language
and culture, that is, grammar and style, vocabulary and its cultural connotations, texts and their
points of view, as inseparable” in order to “foster the three major components of symbolic


**Lovely Professional University** **127**


_**Unit 13: Communicative Competence**_


competence: the production ofcomplexity, the tolerance of ambiguity, and an appreciation of form
as meaning” (Kramsch, 2006, p. 251).


**Critiques of Applying Communicative Competence Theory to Curriculum**

Not all researchers agree with making a direct connection between the theory of CC and its
application to classroom practice. Leung (2005) harshly critiques what he describes as
misapplication of Hymes’ (1972) and Canale and Swain’s (1980) original works to current curricula
development. In the context of teaching English as a Second Language and English as a Foreign
Language, Leung suggests that too much reliance has been placed on the idealized native-speaker,
without giving recognition to the wide variety of Englishes, both as L1s and L2s, that exist
throughout the world. Teachers and publishers can overly homogenize cultural stereotypes when
they create course syllabi, especially by relying on a teachers’ intuitions as native English speakers.
This lack of diversity moves away from Hymes’ idea of appropriateness which should be localized
to social interactions between specific interlocutors (Leung, 2005).

The universal application of CLT to all language learning environments requires some foundational
assumptions: 1) Western pedagogical methods transfer to any learning environment; 2) all language
acquisition occurs through interactive communication; 3) the standard for CC as achieved through
CLT is native speaker proficiency (Jenkins, 2006a). In COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 16
regards to the first and second assumptions, CLT may not transfer, for example, to the Asia-Pacific
region. In regards to the third assumption, not all L2 speakers of English have native English
speakers as their target audience (Jenkins, 2006a). In parts of the world where many English serves
as a common L2 for many people groups to interact together, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF)
makes more sense as a target proficiency than Standard British or American English (Jenkins,
2006a). Calling for recognition of ELF in contrast with English as a Foreign appropriateness
component out of context, expecting that native speaker proficiency is normative and naming nonnative-speakers’ variations as errors instead of standard forms of ELF within a specific context.


The impact of what form of an L1, in this case English, is standard can significantly control
feedback that language learners receive, especially in educational settings. If Standard British or
American English provides the only acceptable language forms that students may produce,
students may receive lower scores on English language assessments for using ELF or English as an
International Language (EIL) forms (Jenkins, 2006b). Current examinations do not account for the
possibility of another non-native English-speaker being the target audience member; if a student
modifies his pronunciation or vocabulary in order to meet the needs of another L2 English-speaker
by increasing mutual intelligibility, the student will be scored lower for not having used the
expected standardized forms (Jenkins, 2006b). Conversely, if a student uses Standard English
forms, including idioms, that his or her interlocutor does not understand, the student will be scored
higher even though the student knowingly prevented the communication from progressing
(Jenkins, 2006b). “From a sociocultural perspective, [non-native speaker] creativity is to be
expected” (Jenkins, 2006b, p. 45). EIL and EFL forms need to COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE
17 be granted equal power status and afforded the same acceptance level of correctness as Standard
British and American English.


**13.4** **Communicative Competence in Multilinguals**

L2 speakers who develop CC in the target language also have CC in their L1. This ability to
maneuver effectively in both languages can be called multicompetence. The L1 knowledge
influences the L2 language being learned. “No matter how advanced L2 users are in the L2, their
L2 knowledge is different from that of native speakers of that language” (Hall, Cheng, & Carlson,
2006, p. 221). An interlanguage, specific to the L2 learner, develops as the learner navigates back
and forth between the two languages. Interlanguage is not an expression of linguistic deficits but
rather a demonstration of the process the L2 learner is going through as he or she develops CC.
Not only does the L1 influence the L2, but also the L2 impacts the L1, as well, in a process called
bidirectional transfer. While not always the case, L2 learners typically have more varied
communicative experiences than do monolinguals (Hall et al., 2006). These findings demonstrate
that first language acquisition research can be difficult to apply to SLA, as the experiences and
understandings of multilinguals and monolinguals may be quite disparate.

**Difficulty in Implementation of Communicative Language Teaching**

Even if CC is considered a desirable goal of language learning and CLT is considered the desirable
pedagogical approach for achieving CC, implementing CLT comes with several substantial
challenges. In discussing the difficulties of implementing CLT methodology, Gatbonton and
Segalowitz (2005) define one aspect of CC as automatic fluency. Teachers may feel that automatic
fluency is unattainable, and they may also resist implementing CLT because it is not as tangible as
the grammatical approaches they have experienced before. Furthermore, CLT requires much more
student interaction than a teacher-centered classroom of years past.


**Communicative Competence**

In one CLT methodology, ACCESS, a teacher explains some minimal language aspects before a
specified task (Gatbonton and Segalowitz, 2005). Then, the students participate in said activities
must lead to the use of utterances that have clear pragmatic functions (be useful in real world
communication) and that have high re-use potential” (Gatbonton & Segalowitz, 2005, p. 333).
Teachers may lead students to a focus on form as long as the activity “improve[s] students’
knowledge of the targeted utterances” (Gatbonton & Segalowitz, 2005, p. 334) and the students
have already experienced the utterances upon which the class would focus. Corrective feedback
within this model includes “prompting and sociolinguistically authentic interventions (e.g., recasts,
repetitions, confirmation checks, and elicitations)” (Gatbonton & Segalowitz, 2005, p. 337) but only
on the targeted utterances. Corrective feedback is not provided for off-topic utterances. This
approach “rejects the view that students should only be exposed to correct versions” (Gatbonton &
Segalowitz, 2005, p. 340) of the targeted utterances, instead allowing incorrect forms to provide
opportunities for learning. ACCESS uses language analysis only as a means to achieve automatic
fluency. While the authors suggest that ACCESS could be extended to all four language modalities,
the interactive nature seems to focus on oral language, the very concern about CLT mentioned
above by university-level language instructors. Future of Communicative Language Teaching
Instruction


While many consider CLT to be a natural outgrowth of CC research, further language pedagogy
approaches are still being created. Post-CLT methodologies have now developed, such as TaskBased Language Teaching, Focus on Form, Cooperative Language Learning, and Content-Based
Instruction (López Rama & Luque Agulló, 2012). Some researchers find that neither extreme of the
CLT spectrum—1) a shallow end where grammar was explicitly taught COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 19 and 2) a deep end where grammar was completely avoided so as not to impede
communication—has been capable of leading students to communicative competence (López Rama
& Luque Agulló, 2012). The shallow end leads students to know a great deal about grammar while
being incapable of communicating, and the deep end leads students to communicate, but
inaccurately. “Communicative competence has given way to a broader view in which sociocultural, pragmatic and discourse issues are combined with a notion of language based on
computational linguistics, these post-CLT methodologies still are informed by Hallidayan ideas of
function and should include an attention to grammar. Teachers seem more willing to integrate
grammar and communication of meaning, recognizing that “conscious knowledge can become
unconscious or automatized…and, alternately, unconscious knowledge can be analyzed” (López
Rama and Luque Agulló, 2012, p. 183). It seems that in order to achieve CC, both a metaawareness of language development and opportunities for authentic language use must exist,
together, in the second-language classroom.


Another extension of CLT concerns multimodal competence. While a shift from more traditional
grammar/structure-based pedagogy to communicative/function-based pedagogy is in process,
currently CLT focuses only on verbal meaning. The internet and other resources now provide
students with extensive access to both verbal and visual meaning representations. The same
concerns of building competence in contextually appropriate verbal communication cross over to
the need to build competence in contextually appropriate visual communication. Teachers need to
address how verbal and visual communication together influence and change the intent and impact
of the other, including how this interrelation changes in different cultures.

_**Unit 13: Communicative Competence**_


An additional goal of the language classroom, then, is to help students “become competent
ininterpreting and constructing appropriate meanings multimodally” (Royce, 2007, p. 374).
Relationship between Communicative Competence and Interactional Competence While
communicative competence and CLT have been well developed in the literature over the last forty
years, IC is a more recent notion. Frequently referenced early works by Kramsch and Hall will be
cited as seminal pieces upon which newer research builds. This section will define IC, contrast IC
with CC, discuss requisite skills and tools for IC learning and assessment, provides examples of IC
development, and demonstrate IC in educational settings for different age levels.

Definition of Interactional Competence In an oft-cited article, Kramsch (1986) critiques the
ACTFL/ETS Proficiency Guidelines as input-output, static, linear, and accuracy-focused, arguing
that the guidelines assessed items easy to test without assessing one’s ability to participate in
authentic discourse. An example might include assessing if a student can form a question, but not
assessing the function the question would have within a discourse (such as using a rhetorical
question to stall for more (Kramsch, 1986, p. 369) can cause just as much communication
breakdown, if not more, as a forgotten adjectival ending or verb conjugation. Therefore, language
study should lead to IC with a goal of “intercultural understanding” (Kramsch, 1986, p. 370). Many
researchers have attempted to define and clarify the concept of IC, with varying levels of
overlapping ideas. IC requires more than pragmatic competence; it also required shared
knowledge (Young, 2011). IC focuses on “co-construction,” an incorporation of “a range of
interactional processes, including collaboration, cooperation, and coordination” (May, 2009, p.
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE  21 398 and considers “how individual competence is
connected to, and partially constructed by both those with whom [a language learner] is interacting
and the larger sociohistorical forces” (Lee, 2006, p. 353). Furthermore, IC is “necessary for
sustaining social interaction and relies upon the speakers’ ability to use resources drawn from
interactive practices” (Masuda, 2011, p. 520). Other definitions of IC include, “the ability to develop
and manage topic issues in practice-relevant ways” (Hall, 1995, p. 39), “a learner’s ability to coconstruct appropriate linguistics forms, registers, and sequential routines in appropriate contexts in
order to accomplish discursive practices” (Hellermann, 2007, p. 85), “the ability to appropriately
and effectively participate in conversations” (Todhunter, 2007, p. 605), and “a competence that
accounts not only for linguistic changes, but also for the changes in the participation methods of an
L2 speaker in a particular community of practice” (König, 2013, p. 227). The recurring theme found
in these definitions includes a focus on initiating and responding appropriately and successfully in
conversations with others.


Hall and Pekarek Doehler (2011) define IC as “the context-specific constellations of expectations
and dispositions about our social words that we draw on to navigate our interactions with others,

[implying] the ability to mutually coordinate our actions” (p. 1). Hall and Pekarek Doehler’s
explanation seems to derive from Hymes’ initial notion of CC: “It includes the…resources
conventionally used for producing and interpreting turns and actions…so that they are
recognizable for others, and to repair problems in maintaining shared understanding” (Hall &
Pekarek Doehler, 2011, p. 2). L2 speakers must know when and how to take a stance in an
interactive setting as well as when and how to respond to another interlocutor. They must
overcome communication barriers that arise during these interactions through various strategies
such as circumlocution.


**Communicative Competence**

Within this context-based IC paradigm, grammar takes on a different meaning. Rather than a
prescriptive set of rules found in textbooks, grammar becomes a group of patterns that are
experienced repeatedly within those contexts. Language learners come to anticipate those patterns
and are able to move from “peripheral to fuller participation” (Young & Miller, 2004, p. 519). Once
language learner’s IC has developed more, their “interactional involvement, in turn, helps [their]
grammars stay in shape” (Hall, 2004, p. 610). Differences from Communicative Competence While
CC research does inform IC, each views the L2 speaker from a different viewpoint. IC requires
engaging with another person in a situation while CC is focused on the individual alone: “IC is
distributed across participants and varied in different interactional practices….IC is not what a
person knows, it is what a person does together with others [emphasis in original]” (Young, 2011,
p. 430). IC develops in context-specific situations where language learners “[participate] with more
experienced others in specific interactive practices” (Young, 2011, p. 20). IC “is not an individual
achievement;…it is co-constructed by all participants in an interaction” (Young, 2011, p. 32).
Masuda (2011) differentiates CC as being context independent and IC as being “a co-construction in


**130** **Lovely Professional University**

_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


an interactive episode…specific to the practice” (p. 520). Pekarek Doehler (2013) concurs that IC is
concerned with the specific context and that generalizations cannot be separated from the context in
which the interaction takes place. The research on IC repeatedly points to the experience of coconstruction as an essential part of IC.

Hall and Pekarek Doehler (2011) claim that prior CC research has focused on the skill of speaking,
the language of an individual, rather than on the skill of interaction, the language of two or more
interlocutors negotiating meaning together. In contrast, the CEFR defines the COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 23 receptive skills of listening and reading and the productive skills of speaking
and writing, along with the interactive skills of speaking and writing. The CEFR notes that “the
acquisition of receptive competences does not automatically guarantee that learners also have
interactional competences” (Vetter, 2011, p. 356). Requisite Skills for Interactional Competence IC
develops as language learners participate in context-specific conversations, and this development is
necessary for “competent participation in a community’s significant practices” (Hall, 1995, p. 39).
Understanding the socio-culturally expected interactions set up by an initial utterance allows
interlocutors to anticipate specific lexical features, prepare their responses that follow turn-by-turn,
and know better how to recover from misunderstandings (Hall, 1995). In order to develop IC,
language learners must integrate a variety of skills. Young’s (2000) six-component framework of IC
includes: “rhetorical script…, specific register…, strategies for taking turns…, management of
topics…, patterns in interaction…, and signaling for boundaries” (Young, 2000, p. 8-10). Strategies
for taking turns, topic management, and signaling for boundaries are identify specific skills
necessary for IC (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011).


Practicesconsidered significant by and to the learners, and (2) the systematic study of L2 interactive
practice, including their conventional resources and typical meanings, their varied uses by the
participants of the practices and the consequences engendered by these uses” (Hall, 1999, p. 137).
Learners must notice the language that co-exists with a specific context and recognize that the
context limits the language choices that they may make. Specifically, teachers must guide learners
to recognize patterns of interaction. Items to analyze include “setting(s),… COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 24 and their sequential development,… participation structures,… and the
formulaic openings, transitions, and closings (Hall, 1999, p. 146-148). Beginning language learners
should focus on more ritualized contexts, while more advanced learners can consideration
variations found in less ritualized contexts.


While linguistic proficiency and contextual awareness are necessary for communication to take
place, an internal motivation is also necessary: “successful communication is not just about shared
knowledge of linguistic cues but also, and perhaps more importantly, a shared identity from their
ability to use language, with this identity affecting motivation for learning more language. While
interaction with more proficient language users can increase IC, the L2 speakers desiring growth
must feel welcome within the interaction. If the more proficient language users view themselves as
collaborators in the process alongside the L2 speakers, instead of the experts who have more power
than the L2 speakers, the L2 speakers’ motivation and sense of identity will be more likely to push
them to develop greater L2 proficiency (Hall et al., 2004). In the classroom, teachers need to be
intentional about building this collaborative dynamic wherein all students have valuable ideas to
offer to the class.


Teachers are likely to view students who employ greater classroom interaction as “active, creative,
and successful” (Hall & Walsh, 2002, p. 191) language users. Typically, teachers use an initiationresponse-evaluation (IRE) format of question and answer in the classroom. This process does not
lead students to extended interactions, however, and opportunities for language growth are lost. If
teachers change the third component evaluation to follow-up, thus an IRF format, the interaction is
extended and students have an opportunity to demonstrate their desire COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 25 to use the language (Hall & Walsh, 2002). As mentioned previously, language
learners need opportunities for interaction in order for their IC to grow.

Tools for Interactional Competence Learning and Assessment

When focusing specifically on developing IC of L2 speakers, conversation analysis (CA) can help to
identify changes in L2 speakers’ language and interaction choices. “Foundational to CA is the idea
that individuals in talk-in-interaction are competent individuals who, in sharing social group
membership, share knowledge on which they draw in the accomplishment of their interactional
activities” (Hall, 2009, p. 2). CA, unconcerned with the correctness of language, identifies how
interlocutors make use of language and other resources in a given interaction and must be based on
non-elicited speech (Pekarek Doehler, 2013). “It has been suggested that the development of L2 IC

can be understood and studied in terms of a change in participants’ methods for accomplishing L2
talk-in-interaction” (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011, p. 7). An analysis of the changes an L2 speaker
makes in a recurring interactional task over time can reveal the acquisition of both language and
socio-culturally appropriate behaviors that has occurred (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011).

L2 IC requires the acquisition of several context-specific conversation development strategies.
Interactional moves that L2 learners must acquire to competently participate in L1interactions
include “turn-taking, opening or closing conversations, prefacing stories, proffering
disagreements,” (Pekarek Doehler, 2013, p. 150). Other aspects include “gaze and bodily
contact,…systematic procedures,…precision timing and the sequential organization of actions and
turns at talk” (Pekarek Doehler, 2013, p. 150). CA allows a focus on L2 speakers’ appropriation of
resources rather than on comparison to native-speaker language, for “in the coordination of these
resources for all practical purposes…lies the L2 speaker’s interactional COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 26competence” (Pekarek Doehler, 2013, p. 155). Furthermore, L2 speakers
demonstrate IC through discursive practices, “recurring episodes of social interaction in
context…of social and cultural significance to a community of speakers” such as “greeting, leavetaking, and picking up a child from school” (Young, 2011, p. 427). By analyzing actual transcripts
of what people say in order to accomplish certain goals, teachers and L2 learners can identify what
is necessary to achieve those goals in terms of interaction and communication. Teachers can also
identify areas where their L2 speakers need to continue to develop.

CA can lead adult language learners to be “better able to anticipate, interpret, and engagein
culturally recognizable practices through talk-in-interaction when using the target language” (Fujii,
2012, p. 102). Other benefits include “[helping] learners both to overcome certain psychological
barriers to language learning and also to notice a number of aspects of L2 interactions which
otherwise may have escaped them” (Fujii, 2012, p. 112). Language learners are sometimes
unwilling to mimic the culturally appropriate behavior that they notice. Although language
learners need to be aware of L2 pragmatics, they should not be compelled to assimilate into the L2
culture mindlessly. While teachers should expose language learners to L2 norms, L2 speakers must
have the choice of whether or not to use native speaker-like language forms (Fujii, 2012). Choosing
to appropriate a culture’s linguistic moves and behaviors is part of one’s identity, and the student,
himself or herself, should make his or her own identity decisions, not the teacher. When language
learners recognize how L2 norms impact how language is created and received, learners “develop a
critical awareness of language use and…are empowered to make choices about whether to
participate and, when doing so, how to use the resources in ways that will enhance the realization
of their own individual goals” (Hall, 1999, p. 150).


**Communicative Competence**

Hellermann (2007) stated that IC development is evident when looking at how a learner modifies
his or her interactions to these discursive practices in similar situations over time.

Assessing IC, therefore, should focus more on paired and group student interaction, rather than
interaction solely between teacher and student (May, 2009). With this in mind, IC assessment must
look at the interaction as a whole, rather than the IC of any one participant. In contrast to typical
teacher-student language proficiency interviews, “paired speaking tests have the potential to elicit
features of interactional competence, including a range of conversation management skills” (May,
2009, p. 415). Raters used to the traditional teacher-student interviews may find that the relational
dynamic between dyad members impacts how the participants respond in the interaction, and this
dynamic can cause raters great difficulty in determining how to assess fair individual scores.


**Examples of Interactional Competence Development**

If language learners have the opportunity to speak repeatedly with more experienced speakers in
similar contexts, these language learners will increase their IC (Masuda, 2011). Masuda’s study
reviews the acquisition of the interactional particle (IP) ne by Japanese as a Foreign Language
Learners in a study abroad program. This IP allows turn-taking in a conversation to move forward,
as ne is used in manners such as “displaying and seeking agreement or confirmation, initiating
interaction, introducing a new topic, and mitigating face threatening acts” (Masuda, 2011, p. 521).
Repeated interactions with a focus on ne lead some learners to move from infrequent, and
sometimes incorrect, use further along a continuum towards non-formulaic, intentional use in
conversations with native-speakers. However, language learners’ beliefs about identity roles
associated with a form (e.g. a male learner finding ne to be too effeminate) can prevent the learner


**132** **Lovely Professional University**



_**Notes**_


_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


from developing IC with that form. Moreover, COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 28 language
learners at lower proficiency levels are slower to build their IC due to less ability to initiate and
participate in conversations with native speakers (Masuda, 2011).

When considering L2 request approaches, some universal or cross-cultural trends tend tohappen
with request interactions (Taleghani-Nikazm and Huth, 2010). According to CA, speakers receive
acceptance responses more often to offers than to requests. Therefore, a request might contain prerequest hedging, such as a question to raise the topic, a demonstration of the need for an acceptance
response, or an expression of preference. This attention to requests is part of the general CA
sequence organization concept, and L2 speakers with lower proficiency levels struggle more with
negotiating the sequences needed to make a request (Taleghemi-Nikazm & Huth, 2010). Sequence
organization, in relation with lexis and syntax, can be used to triangulate results to “show how
notions regarding the sociality, appropriateness, directness, or politeness of L2 learners’ talk
emerges from the data as collaborative achievements” (Taleghemi-Nikazm & Huth, 2010, p. 189).
Thus, sequence forms part of Hymes’ appropriateness component of CC in an interactional setting.

The discursive practice of writing conferences can lead a novice student to improve hislanguage
through revision talk (Young & Miller, 2004). Through these writing conferences, not only does the
student increase his IC but the instructor does, as well. In Young and Miller’s (2004) study, the
instructor initially models the expected turns to be taken during the writing conference, but over
time the instructor learns which turns the student can take up. Eventually, the student takes up all
of the expected turns except those that solely belong to the instructor.


**13.5** **Interactional Competence in Education at Different Age Levels**

Hall’s (1995) study indicates that foreign language classrooms provide little modeling of what these
interactions should look like and little opportunity for students to experience extended
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 29talk interactions, such that students can learn how to
appropriately manage a topic in conversation in their new local cultural settings. L2 speakers need
both the modeling and the opportunity for interactional practice to succeed in interactions with
other speakers of the target language (Hall, 1995). In the following paragraphs, L2 IC growth is
discussed for a young child, for high school students, and for adults.Cekaite (2007) addresses the IC
that develops in a 7-year-old Kurdish girl in an immersion classroom in Sweden, observing that the
girl must learn “not only socialization to the cultural norms of the target culture, but also
socialization into the interactional norms and practices appropriate to a specific classroom activity”
(Cekaite, 2007, p. 46). Cekaite (2007) remarks that “children need initially to acquire analytic
representations of pragmatic knowledge, and more or less fully develop them by school age,
whereas adults may rely on universal pragmatic knowledge, acquired through participation in a
variety of communities of practice” (p. 47). Cekaite’s study considers how the girl participates in
multiparty conversational activities in the classroom setting. At first, the girl is mostly silent and
considered a compliant student. Then, as the girl’s L2 proficiency improves, she demonstrates
culturally inappropriate behavior because, while she has language to express herself, she does not
understand how and when to make her voice heard in the context of the classroom. By the end of
the year, the girl’s IC grows in parallel with her improved language proficiency, and she
participates in culturally appropriate ways both in response to others and through self-initiated
speech acts. Cekaite’s (2007) study demonstrates that linguistic proficiency grows at a different rate
than IC, and both are required for successful interaction in specific contexts. Teachers must not
anticipate that linguistic proficiency growth is predictive of IC growth, or vice-versa. Both must be
monitored and instructed in tandem but without a specific rate linked between them.


**Communicative Competence**

IC development in the classroom happens when students take part in “exchanges that are
spontaneous, topically coherent, and extend over multiple turns” (Todhunter, 2007, p. 605), which
can be difficult to do in a school setting. Instructional conversation in high school can provide a
natural interaction within the school setting where IC can be developed as students interactively
learn about curricular concepts. Providing a transition between formal instructional activities, this
conversation allows opportunities for authentic question and response between teachers and
students and for students to initiate target language conversations. When necessary, the teacher
can help students with necessary repairs in context and keep the conversation movingforward.
Furthermore, students can co-construct their understanding of the teacher’s target-language speech.
“Interactionally competent speakers negotiate meaning in order to repair communication

breakdowns. However, achieving mutual understanding does not always lead to resolution or
awareness of grammatical form” (Todhunter, 2007, p. 614). Instructional conversation allows
teachers to lead students to correct grammatical forms while the students also build their IC.

Learners through dyadic interactions. Students with lower English proficiency participate in little
pre-task talking, as opposed to students with higher English proficiency who spend some time in
small talk before beginning paired-work tasks assigned by the teacher. Furthermore, paired
students will adopt teacher-modeled language and peer language or mutually use available verbal
and non-verbal resources together as they attempt to prepare for and participate in teacherassigned tasks (Hellermann, 2007).


Using the concept of topic as her lens for understanding IC, König (2013) studies how a Germanspeaking au pair initiates conversations using self-selected topics during a year
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 31 stay with a French-speaking family. Over time, the au pair
increases her sensitivity in how to though the au pair is an advanced French L2 speaker, her
linguistic structures do not improve significantly in the year-long study. Nevertheless, the manner
in which those linguistic structures are employed does show an increase of IC (König, 2013). At an
adult level, this also demonstrates the different rates of linguistic and IC growth.


Adult learners may “rely to some extent on their L1 interactional competence” as they interact in
the L2 (Barraja-Rohan, 2011, p. 485). L1 interactional skills and knowledge do not automatically
transfer to L2 IC. By using CA to identify IC features missing from students’ speech (e.g. response
tokens, assessments, and adjacency pairs), teacher-modified lessons can make adult students
explicitly aware of these items. These lessons can lead to student conversations which demonstrate
greater integration of the initial lacking IC skills (Barraja-Rohan, 2011).


**Conclusion**

Second and foreign language teachers must instruct much more than mere syntactic and lexical
structures because students in L2 language classes need to know how to interact effectively with
the L2 world around them, in schools, in the community, and at work. Communicative competence
and now interactional competence, along with their associated pedagogies, provide goals that
teachers may strive to help their students attain. When an L2 speaker can comprehend, respond to,
and initiate interactions with native target language speakers in ways in which the L2 speaker can
understand the meaning, intent and cultural expectations of the interactions, these goals will have
been achieved.

The literature begins to position CC in SLA contexts with the intent of providing a framework for
developing second language course syllabi. Canale and Swain (1980) specifically address CC’s
definition and development in an article focused on second language teaching.Canale and Swain
(1980) use CC “to refer to the relationship and interaction between grammatical competence…and
sociolinguistic competence” (p. 6). This mirrors Hymes’ (1972) claim that grammar rules are
incomplete without rules of use. Canale and Swain’s (1980) purpose in asserting this definition is to
provide guidelines for how to develop communicative COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 5
course syllabi, namely that grammar and sociolinguistics features must both be included in second
language coursework and both must be assessed, as well. This is in sharp contrast to the grammarcentered syllabi found in most coursework by Canale and Swain (1980).

Savignon (1991) also mentions a divergence between more grammar-based and notional-functional
syllabi. Savignon (1991) recounts the European development as being “derived from neo-Firthian
systemic or functional linguistics that views language as meaning potential and maintains the
centrality of context of situation” (p. 263). Notional-functional syllabi have been developed in
Europe using this paradigm, where curricula are developed based on students’ needs for
communication rather than on a stratified sequence of grammatical structures that grow

increasingly more difficult. At the same time, developments in the United States have centered on
Hymes’ reaction to Chomsky’s theories.

In developing her own definition and application of CC, Savignon (2002) mentions that Hymes uses
CC “to represent the ability to use language in a social context, to observe sociolinguistic norms of
appropriateness” (p. 2) and maintains that “Hymes’ focus was not language learning but language
as social behavior [emphasis in original]” (p. 2). Savignon (2002) herself uses the term CC “to
characterize the ability of classroom language learners to interact with other speakers, to make
meaning, as distinct from their ability to recite dialogues or perform on discrete-point tests of
grammatical knowledge” (p. 3). Therefore, Savignon’s paradigm focuses on what a second
language learner can do with the language in authentic settings, not just on the ability to memorize
chunks of language for artificial, planned experiences.

Not only does CC include the ability to make meaning in authentic contexts, it also includes an
assumption of facility. In his study of interlanguage analysis, Pallotti (2010) COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 6 distinguishes between CC and linguistic competence, but he also indicates that
CC is “further divided into efficacy (the ability to reach one’s communicative goals) and fluency
(the ability to do so smoothly, quickly and effortlessly)” (p. 173). Pallotti’s definition, including
fluency with its describing adverbs of “smoothly, quickly, and effortlessly” seems to shift the focus
from merely being able to negotiate meaning—regardless of the accompanying false starts and
halted language—to a concept where the negotiation of language happens with a great deal of
automaticity.

One further extension development to the concept of CC is that it occurs in an interactive process.
Hall and Pekarek Doehler (2011) extend the notion of CC to IC in this way: “Central to competent
engagement in our interactions is our ability to accomplish meaningful social actions, to respond to
c-participants’ [sic] previous actions and to make recognizable for others what our actions are and
how these relate to their own actions” (p. 1). L2 speakers demonstrate IC when they make
appropriate use of language in extended, turn-taking. They understand, according to a situational
specific socio-cultural context, the intent of the language moves made by the other interlocutors in
the setting, and the L2 speakers know how, again according to that same context, to make further
language moves such that their communicative output will be taken up in the manner that the L2
speakers intend.


**Synthesized Definition**

To restate the initial claimed definition, CC can be defined as the ability to use language, or to
communicate, in a culturally appropriate manner in order to make meaning and accomplish social
tasks with efficacy and fluency through extended interactions. This definition can be analyzed as
follows. First, L2 speakers must have the ability to use language itself, including the ability to form
grammatically possible and feasible locutions (Hymes, 1972). Second, L2 COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 7 speakers must demonstrate the inclusion of the socio-cultural component of
cultural appropriateness (Hymes, 1972; Canale & Swain, 1980). Third, L2 speakers must be able to
make meaning, not merely regurgitate memorized phrases or answer correctly on discrete
grammar point tests (Savignon, 2002). Fourth, L2 speakers must use language in ways that are
effective in accomplishing their desired tasks in a facile, almost unconscious manner (Palloti, 2010).
Finally, L2 speakers must be able to achieve these communicative tasks in social, extended
interactions wherein they have the skills and understanding to decode and encode messages with
appropriate socio-cultural intent (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011). Through understanding these
components, second-language instructors can more clearly understand theintended goal or
outcome of their courses.

Necessity to Focus on Communicative Competence in Teaching “The role of the language teacher is
to help learners get along in real-life situations” (Savignon, 1997, p. 114). L2 speakers must be able
to process and interact with the language they experience in order to succeed in the sociocultural
contexts in which they find themselves.

Whether in the classroom, the grocery store, or the workplace, if L2 speakers do not have access to
this language, they have less opportunity and less power to interact as equal members of
socialinteractions. CC as a goal, through various Communicative Language Teaching
(CLT)methodologies, allows L2 speakers the cultural and linguistic knowledge needed to handle
the interactional challenges presented to them.

When preparing to teach L2 speakers a second or foreign language, teachers must realize that
correct L2 grammar and denotative meanings are insufficient to prepare those L2 speakers for real

interactions in the target language. L2 speakers must understand the intent of communication,
embedded in specific cultural settings, in order to fully demonstrate CC COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 8 (Savignon, 1997). The following research discusses the value of CLT,
measurement of CC, the role of pragmatics within CLT, differing opinions within academia of the
value and purpose of language courses, critiques of applying CC theory to curriculum, difficulties
of implementing CLT, and the future of CLT.


**Value of Communicative Language Teaching**

The tension between a focus on grammar and a focus on communicating meaning has created an
either/or mindset in language instruction. However, putting these two foci in conflict is inaccurate:
L2 speakers must not only make themselves understood to native language speakers but also use
correct grammar in the process (Canale & Swain, 1980). Canale and Swain’s (1980) components of
CC can be defined as follows: “grammatical…knowledge of lexical items and rules of morphology,
syntax, semantics and phonology; sociolinguistic… knowledge of rules of language use;
strategic…knowledge of strategies to overcome communicative problems; and,
discourse…knowledge needed to participate in literacy activities” (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2001, p.
3). Savignon (1997) uses these four components to develop a study comparing a CLT approach
with a traditional grammar approach. Students in the CLT group perform better on grammar
assessments than students whose instruction focuses solely on grammatical structures.
Furthermore, students experiencing a CLT approach are also able to communicate more easily in
spontaneous communicative interactions than do students who onlyexperience traditional
grammar teaching (Savignon, 1997). When L2 speakers experience pedagogical opportunities for
communicative practice (using language authentic contexts ratherthan isolated, grammar drills),
their facility for more natural use develops. Lightbown and Spada (2013) conclude that Savignon’s
study “offers support for the hypothesis that meaning-based instruction is advantageous, not that
form-based instruction is not” (Chapter 6, Section 1, para.


**Communicative Competence**

While CLT does provide an opportunity for students to be creative in their use of language, it does
not have to exclude a focus on form. Teachers can help language learners acquire variations of
textbook language by appropriating a “sociocultural framework of pragmatics as mediated action”
(Van Compernolle, 2013, p. 358). In Van Compernolle’s (2013) study, the tu vs. vous formality
dichotomy helps students know when to use the pronouns on or nous and when to leave out or use
the negativeparticle ne. Students learn not just what the words mean, but what kind of attitude the
students will convey based on these language and grammatical choices. When teachers begin
with“meanings - concepts - that are important for learners to appropriate rather than forms or
structures” (Van Compernolle, 2013, p. 358), students begin to make situation-specific appropriate
use of formal and informal language markers without mediated support. Thisframework uses
dynamically-administered scenarios to simultaneously assess students’ current competence with
expressing a concept while also guiding the students who are unable to perform independently.
While direct instruction, awareness-building, and noticing are useful in language study, they are
insufficient to lead to competence (Van Compernolle, 2013). Van Compernolle (2013) and Savignon
(1997) both demonstrate that focusing on meaning while also drawing attention to form can lead L2
speakers to CC, including appropriate grammar usage.


**Measurement of Communicative Competence**

One aspect of teaching and learning for which teachers are accountable is reporting progress that
students make, often in a quantifiable form. Several monographs address how to quantify CC (i.e.,
identify or label a CC level) in terms of the Common European Framework of Reference for
Languages (CEFR), including some discussions considering the validity of comparing proficiency
levels to CC (Bartning, Martin, & Vedder, 2010). Teachers should COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 10 hesitate using a focus on errors for assessing beginners’ proficiency levels;
instead, teacher must understand the sophisticated development of a learner’s interlanguage: “one
should always bear in mind that…‘accuracy growth’ and ‘interlanguage development’ do not
represent the same construct” (Pallotti, 2010, p. 163). Teachers should also be careful to focus on
the meaning and intent of proficiency level descriptions rather than converting proficiency level to
a numerical percentage (Pallotti, 2010). Numerical scores may be easy to calculate, but they do not
describe the nuances of language development that teachers must consider as they develop lessons.

Vocabulary growth can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine proficiency level, such as foundin
the CEFR (Milton, 2010). L2 speakers’ word choices reveal how broadly and deeply they can
interact with topics. Beginning speakers will demonstrate word choices concerning very specific,
personal experience topics while advancing speakers will be demonstrate word choices about less
immediate topics, as well. CC growth can also be observed “both at the level of expanding one’s
range of communicative activities and at the level of performing them in increasingly more
complex and sophisticated ways” (Hulstihn, Alderson, and Schoonen, 2010, p.

12). Inorder for a student to fully develop his or her communicative competence, both breadth and
depth must take place in the classroom activities an L2 speaker experiences.


**13.6** **Role of Pragmatics in Communicative Language Teaching**

As mentioned above, mastery of surface level structures, understanding denotative word
meaningsand being able to construct grammatically correct sentences, is insufficient for achieving
CC. L2 speakers must be able to navigate the sociocultural contexts in which they must actually use
the language. For example, if a child who forget to bring bread to the table, a parent, as an
authority, might remark, “Where’s the bread? Who set the table? I don’t see the bread” (Savignon,
1997, p. 19). The child is to infer that an indirect command is being given COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE  11 without the parent using a grammatically imperative sentence. This
understanding of nuance, of knowing the meaning intended by the speaker within the specific
context, goes much deeper than explanations provided by dictionary definitions or grammar
textbooks. Pragmatics creates a lens in which to understand CC in real life situations where
intentions and expectations of linguistic and behavioral interactions are often left implicit.

Research in SLA often does not match practice in the classroom. Ishihara (2007)
writes,“Althoughpragmatic ability (the ability to use language effectively to achieve a specific
purpose and understand language in context) has been recognized as an essential component of
communicative competence…, pragmatics has not been fully incorporated into today’s
second/foreign language (L2) teaching and teacher education [emphasis in original]” (p. 21).

Lessons on why and when to use specific speech acts such as thanking or apologizing, beyond
simply how to form the words for the speech act, help students to understand cultural
appropriateness better. Journaling allows students to compare their own cultural experiences with
the expectations of the new culture and creates a metapragmatic awareness in students that allows
them to process “the cultural ideologies underlying the L2 use” (Ishihara, 2007, p. 32) and helps
them to make choices of “how to express themselves through the L2” (Ishihara, 2007, p. 32). While
students may be overwhelmed by the amount of information developed through a lesson based on
pragmatics, an explicit approach in which students are taught to use noticing techniques may
“[provide] an insider perspective of the target culture” (Ishihara, 2007, p. 32) often lacking in formal
language instruction.

Vásquez and Fioramente (2011) echo the importance of teaching pragmatics to students and are
concerned about the lack of pragmatics instruction within ESL master’s degree programs in the
United States. In their words, “to be a competent language user, an individual must have
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 12 the ability to produce utterances which are grammatical
as well as appropriate to the context in which they are made, considering the participants, their
relationships, as well as the (often unstated but assumed) social rules for interaction” (Vásquez &
Fioramente, 2011, p. 1). Pragmatics within ESL instruction may be narrowed to the areas of speech
acts, language functions, and linguistic politeness, with explicit instruction needed in each area
(Vásquez & Fioramente, 2011). While ESL teachers may be prepared to help ELLs form language
structures (Hymes’ possibility and feasibility criteria), these teachers might not be prepared to
address Hymes’ appropriateness criterion in their curricula. Teachers may not have identified the
indirect language needed for appropriate interactions in the L2, taking this understanding for
granted. Assignments with real-world applications can help teachers and their students to
understand the implications of pragmatics and thus their importance (Vásquez & Fioramente,
2011).

Teachers may be reluctant to participate in voluntary professional development offerings focused
on pragmatics, even though the research clearly calls for it as part of CC and shows instruction in
pragmatics to be effective (Vellenga, 2011). Teachers may feel pragmatics are not as important as
teaching linguistic features or that there is no time in language courses to integrate pragmatics. In
Vellenga’s (2011) study, teachers are encouraged to use contrastive analysis with their students to
compare L1 and L2 approaches to speech acts such as greetings, requests, and refusals. Some


**Lovely Professional University** **137**


_**Unit 13: Communicative Competence**_


teachers, who use English-only methodologies, report feeling confused about asking students to
think about how these speech acts occur in the L1 but value this approach when they receive
appropriate training, nonetheless. One participant in Vellenga’s (2011) study specifically
recognizes the need for awareness building of American pragmatics for COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE  13 ESL teachers, as these teachers might take for granted American routines or
expectations and not know what items to help their students notice.

Zapata (2005) likens Ishihara’s insider perspective to Byram’s intercultural communicative
competence and Kramsch’s third place, “the intersection between the native and target cultures
where learners have a deep understanding of both” (Zapata, 2005, p. 261).

Zapata’s study demonstrates how comparison of native speaker experts’ analyses of a piece
ofliterature with university level L2 students’ analyses leads students to understand not just the
language of the story but also the cultural context in which it is written. The native speakers’
analyses consistently articulate a religious theme, even though no religious ideas are mentioned in
the story, but the L2 students do not address this theme. This comparison helps the L2 students to
see how cultural aspects frame the way in which native speakers interpret the language around
them.


**13.7** **Differing Opinions in Academia About Purpose and Content of**

**Language Courses**

The literature presents several articles centered on a division among foreign language and second
language teachers between a focus on literature instruction and a focus on language instruction that
often takes the form of CLT. Rifkin (2006) points out a tendency within SLA pedagogies to focus
only on oral language and reiterates that the ACTFL Proficiency guidelines and the National
Standards for Foreign Language Learning do not give higher precedence to speaking over listening,
reading, and writing. Rifkin states that a dichotomy does not exist between “teaching toward
literacy” and “teaching for proficiency” (p. 263), using proficiency as a synonym for communicative
competence. Rifkin advocates, “The curriculum for communicative language instruction should
require the interpretation of written and spoken texts, including literary texts, in their cultural
context at the introductory and intermediate levels for all COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 14
languages…as preparation for ever greater and more sophisticated learning challenges at each step
of the curriculum” (p. 263). Likewise, Tucker (2006) states that CC’s “received understanding as a
unidirectional, primarily oral mode of functional meaning-making must give way to new
appreciations of dialogical communicative performance as a relational and collaborative act of
subjective negotiation” (p. 265).

Steinhart (2006) uses the terms CC and content to identify the two ideological camps, with language
(i.e. CC) being the focus of beginning and intermediate courses and content the focus of advanced
courses. According to Steinhart, language and content should be present in all courses, regardless
of the level. Elementary programs should have an interactive oral focus and to an extent secondary
programs should, as well. However, all programs should have a full-spectrum articulation goal
leading toward use of the language to learn content. Some teachers might be unwilling to teach
content using the L2 because the teachers themselves are unskilled in the areas of content to study,
due to the mostly oral approaches used in the teachers’ own language studies. Interweaving the
four language skills together can be difficult, especially at the university level where students of all
proficiency levels must quickly move toward advanced content work. Steinhart (2006) offers,
“Perhaps we should…consider how communicative competence might be addressed, spiraled, and
extended through the collegiate sequence of language study” (p. 260). In other words, the ability to
understand, create, and appropriately use language should be a part of all language coursework,
not just the beginning classes.

Students’ interactions today, with other students who have multi-national, multi-lingual, and multi
cultural backgrounds, are very different from when CLT first developed in the 1970s (Kramsch,
2006). At that time, most students’ interactions were with other monolingual students who
belonged to single ethnicities and cultures. Teachers must now think of students not as
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 15 future tourists but as future international workers. This
correlates with a shifted goal in second-language courses from an awareness and ability to parse
the L2 to an ability to use the L2 in authentic contexts. Therefore, teachers must “view language
and culture, that is, grammar and style, vocabulary and its cultural connotations, texts and their
points of view, as inseparable” in order to “foster the three major components of symbolic

competence: the production of complexity, the tolerance of ambiguity, and an appreciation of form
as meaning” (Kramsch, 2006, p. 251).


**Critiques of Applying Communicative Competence Theory to Curriculum**

Not all researchers agree with making a direct connection between the theory of CC and its
application to classroom practice. Leung (2005) harshly critiques what he describes as
misapplication of Hymes’ (1972) and Canale and Swain’s (1980) original works to current curricula
development. In the context of teaching English as a Second Language and English as a Foreign
Language, Leung suggests that too much reliance has been placed on the idealized native-speaker,
without giving recognition to the wide variety of Englishes, both as L1s and L2s, that exist
throughout the world. Teachers and publishers can overly homogenize cultural stereotypes when
they create course syllabi, especially by relying on a teachers’ intuitions as native English speakers.
This lack of diversity moves away from Hymes’ idea of appropriateness which should be localized
to social interactions between specific interlocutors (Leung, 2005).

The universal application of CLT to all language learning environments requires some foundational
assumptions: 1) Western pedagogical methods transfer to any learning environment; 2) all language
acquisition occurs through interactive communication; 3) the standard for CC as achieved through
CLT is native speaker proficiency (Jenkins, 2006a). In COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 16
regards to the first and second assumptions, CLT may not transfer, for example, to the Asia-Pacific
region. In regards to the third assumption, not all L2 speakers of English have native English
speakers as their target audience (Jenkins, 2006a). In parts of the world where many English serves
as a common L2 for many people groups to interact together, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF)
makes more sense as a target proficiency than Standard British or American English (Jenkins,
2006a). Calling for recognition of ELF in contrast with English as a Foreign Language (EFL),
Jenkins (2006a) suggests that most SLA research takes Hymes’ socio-cultural appropriateness
component out of context, expecting that native speaker proficiency is normative and naming nonnative-speakers’ variations as errors instead of standard forms of ELF within a specific context.

The impact of what form of an L1, in this case English, is standard can significantly control
feedback that language learners receive, especially in educational settings. If Standard British or
American English provides the only acceptable language forms that students may produce,
students may receive lower scores on English language assessments for using ELF or English as an
International Language (EIL) forms (Jenkins, 2006b). Current examinations do not account for the
possibility of another non-native English-speaker being the target audience member; if a student
modifies his pronunciation or vocabulary in order to meet the needs of another L2 English-speaker
by increasing mutual intelligibility, the student will be scored lower for not having used the
expected standardized forms (Jenkins, 2006b). Conversely, if a student uses Standard English
forms, including idioms, that his or her interlocutor does not understand, the student will be scored
higher even though the student knowingly prevented the communication from progressing
(Jenkins, 2006b). “From a sociocultural perspective, [non-native speaker] creativity is to be
expected” (Jenkins, 2006b, p. 45). EIL and EFL forms need to COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE
17 be granted equal power status and afforded the same acceptance level of correctness as Standard
British and American English.


**Communicative Competence in Multilinguals**

L2 speakers who develop CC in the target language also have CC in their L1. This ability to
maneuver effectively in both languages can be called multicompetence. The L1knowledge
influences the L2 language being learned. “No matter how advanced L2 users are in the L2, their
L2 knowledge is different from that of native speakers of that language” (Hall, Cheng, & Carlson,
2006, p. 221). An interlanguage, specific to the L2 learner, develops as the learner navigates back
and forth between the two languages. Interlanguage is not an expression of linguistic deficits but
rather a demonstration of the process the L2 learner is going through as he or she develops CC.
Not only does the L1 influence the L2, but also the L2 impacts the L1, as well, in a process called
bidirectional transfer. While not always the case, L2 learners typically have more varied
communicative experiences than do monolinguals (Hall et al., 2006). These findings demonstrate
that first language acquisition research can be difficult to apply to SLA, as the experiences and
understandings of multilinguals and monolinguals may be quite disparate.

Difficulty in Implementation of Communicative Language Teaching Even if CC is considered a
desirable goal of language learning and CLT is considered the desirable pedagogical approach for


**Lovely Professional University** **139**


_**Unit 13: Communicative Competence**_


achieving CC, implementing CLT comes with several substantial challenges. In discussing the
difficulties of implementing CLT methodology, Gatbonton and Segalowitz (2005) define one aspect
of CC as automatic fluency. Teachers may feel that automatic fluency is unattainable, and they may
also resist implementing CLT because it is not as tangible as the grammatical approaches they have
experienced before. Furthermore, CLT requires much more student interaction than a teachercentered classroom of years past.


**Communicative Competence**

In one CLT methodology, ACCESS, a teacher explains some minimal language aspects before a
specified task (Gatbonton and Segalowitz, 2005). Then, the students participate in said task where
they have a gap of information and a genuine need to acquire that information. “The activities
must lead to the use of utterances that have clear pragmatic functions (be useful in real world
communication) and that have high re-use potential” (Gatbonton & Segalowitz, 2005, p. 333).
Teachers may lead students to a focus on form as long as the activity “improve[s] students’
knowledge of the targeted utterances” (Gatbonton & Segalowitz, 2005, p. 334) and the students
have already experienced the utterances upon which the class would focus. Corrective feedback
within this model includes “prompting and sociolinguistically authentic interventions (e.g., recasts,
repetitions, confirmation checks, and elicitations)” (Gatbonton & Segalowitz, 2005, p. 337) but only
on the targeted utterances. Corrective feedback is not provided for off-topic utterances. This
approach “rejects the view that students should only be exposed to correct versions” (Gatbonton &
Segalowitz, 2005, p. 340) of the targeted utterances, instead allowing incorrect forms to provide
opportunities for learning. ACCESS uses language analysis only as a means to achieve automatic
fluency. While the authors suggest that ACCESS could be extended to all four language modalities,
the interactive nature seems to focus on oral language, the very concern about CLT mentioned
above by university-level language instructors.


**13.8** **Future of Communicative Language Teaching Instruction**

While many consider CLT to be a natural outgrowth of CC research, further language pedagogy
approaches are still being created. Post-CLT methodologies have now developed, such as TaskBased Language Teaching, Focus on Form, Cooperative Language Learning, and Content-Based
Instruction (López Rama & Luque Agulló, 2012). Some researchers find that neither extreme of the
CLT spectrum—1) a shallow end where grammar was explicitly taught COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 19 and 2) a deep end where grammar was completely avoided so as not to impede
communication—has been capable of leading students to communicative competence (López Rama
& Luque Agulló, 2012). The shallow end leads students to know a great deal about grammar while
being incapable of communicating, and the deep end leads students to communicate, but
inaccurately.

“Communicative competence has given way to a broader view in which socio-cultural, pragmatic
and discourse issues are combined with a notion of language based on computational analysis”
(López Rama and Luque Agulló, 2012, p. 182). With this move to integrate corpus linguistics, these
post-CLT methodologies still are informed by Hallidayan ideas of function, and should include an
attention to grammar. Teachers seem more willing to integrate grammar and communication of
meaning, recognizing that “conscious knowledge can become unconscious or automatized…and,
alternately, unconscious knowledge can be analyzed” (López Rama and Luque Agulló, 2012, p.
183). It seems that in order to achieve CC, both a meta-awareness of language development and
opportunities for authentic language use must exist, together, in the second-language classroom.

Another extension of CLT concerns multimodal competence. While a shift from more traditional
grammar/structure-based pedagogy to communicative/function-based pedagogy is in process,
currently CLT focuses only on verbal meaning. The internet and other resources now provide
students with extensive access to both verbal and visual meaning representations. The same
concerns of building competence in contextually appropriate verbal communication cross over to
the need to build competence in contextually appropriate visual communication. Teachers need to
address how verbal and visual communication together influence and change the intent and impact
of the other, including how this interrelation changes in different cultures.

An additional goal of the language classroom, then, is to help students “become competent in
interpreting and constructing appropriate meanings multimodally” (Royce, 2007, p. 374).
Relationship between Communicative Competence and Interactional Competence While
communicative competence and CLT have been well developed in the literature over the last forty
years, IC is a more recent notion. Frequently referenced early works by Kramsch and Hall will be
cited as seminal pieces upon which newer research builds. This section will define IC, contrast IC
with CC, discuss requisite skills and tools for IC learning and assessment, provide examples of IC
development, and demonstrate IC in educational settings for different age levels.


**13.9** **Definition of Interactional Competence**

In an oft-cited article, Kramsch (1986) critiques the ACTFL/ETS Proficiency Guidelines as inputoutput, static, linear, and accuracy-focused, arguing that the guidelines assessed items easy to test
without assessing one’s ability to participate in authentic discourse. An example might include
assessing if a student can form a question, but not assessing the function the question would have
within a discourse (such as using a rhetorical question to stall for more time). “Pragmatic
failure,…the inability to understand what is meant by what is said,” (Kramsch, 1986, p. 369) can
cause just as much communication breakdown, if not more, as a forgotten adjectival ending or verb
conjugation. Therefore, language study should lead to IC with a goal of “intercultural
understanding” (Kramsch, 1986, p. 370).

Many researchers have attempted to define and clarify the concept of IC, with varying levels of
overlapping ideas. IC requires more than pragmatic competence; it also required shared
knowledge (Young, 2011). IC focuses on “co-construction,” an incorporation of “a range of
interactional processes, including collaboration, cooperation, and coordination” (May, 2009, p.
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 21 398 and considers “how individual competence is
connected to, and partially constructed by both those with whom [a language learner] is interacting
and the larger sociohistorical forces” (Lee, 2006, p. 353). Furthermore, IC is “necessary for
sustaining social interaction and relies upon the speakers’ ability to use resources drawn from
interactive practices” (Masuda, 2011, p. 520).

Other definitions of IC include, “the ability to develop and manage topic issues in practice-relevant
ways” (Hall, 1995, p. 39), “a learner’s ability to co-construct appropriate linguistics forms, registers,
and sequential routines in appropriate contexts in order to accomplish discursive practices”
(Hellermann, 2007, p. 85), “the ability to appropriately and effectively participate in conversations”
(Todhunter, 2007, p. 605), and “a competence that accounts not only for linguistic changes, but also
for the changes in the participation methods of an L2 speaker in a particular community of
practice” (König, 2013, p. 227). The recurring theme found in these definitions includes a focus on
initiating and responding appropriately and successfully in conversations with others.

Hall and Pekarek Doehler (2011) define IC as “the context-specific constellations of expectations
and dispositions about our social words that we draw on to navigate our interactions with others,

[implying] the ability to mutually coordinate our actions” (p. 1). Hall and Pekarek Doehler’s
explanation seems to derive from Hymes’ initial notion of CC: “It includes the…resources
conventionally used for producing and interpreting turns and actions…so that they are
recognizable for others, and to repair problems in maintaining shared understanding” (Hall &
Pekarek Doehler, 2011, p. 2). L2 speakers must know when and how to take a stance in an
interactive setting as well as when and how to respond to another interlocutor. They must
overcome communication barriers that arise during these interactions through various strategies
such as circumlocution.

**Communicative Competence**

Within this context-based IC paradigm, grammar takes on a different meaning. Rather than a
prescriptive set of rules found in textbooks, grammar becomes a group of patterns that are
experienced repeatedly within those contexts. Language learners come to anticipate those patterns
and are able to move from “peripheral to fuller participation” (Young & Miller, 2004, p. 519). Once
language learner’s IC has developed more, their “interactional involvement, in turn, helps [their]
grammars stay in shape” (Hall, 2004, p. 610).

**13.10** **Differences from Communicative Competence**

While CC research does inform IC, each views the L2 speaker from a different viewpoint. IC
requires engaging with another person in a situation while CC is focused on the individual alone:
“IC is distributed across participants and varied in different interactional practices….IC is not what
a person knows, it is what a person does together with others [emphasis in original]” (Young, 2011,
p. 430). IC develops in context-specific situations where language learners “[participate] with more
experienced others in specific interactive practices” (Young, 2011, p. 20). IC “is not an individual
achievement;…it is co-constructed by allparticipants in an interaction” (Young, 2011, p. 32).
Masuda (2011) differentiates CC as being context independent and IC as being “a co-construction in
an interactive episode…specific to the practice” (p. 520). Pekarek Doehler (2013) concurs that IC is
concerned with the specific context and that generalizations cannot be separated from the context in
which the interaction takes place. The research on IC repeatedly points to the experience of coconstruction as an essential part of IC.

Hall and Pekarek Doehler (2011) claim that prior CC research has focused on the skill of speaking,
the language of an individual, rather than on the skill of interaction, the language of two or more
interlocutors negotiating meaning together. In contrast, the CEFR defines the COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 23 receptive skills of listening and reading and the productive skills of speaking
and writing, along with the interactive skills of speaking and writing. The CEFR notes that“the
acquisition ofreceptive competences does not automatically guarantee that learners also have
interactional competences” (Vetter, 2011, p. 356).


**Requisite Skills for Interactional Competence**

IC develops as language learners participate in context-specific conversations, and this
development is necessary for “competent participation in a community’s significant practices”
(Hall, 1995, p. 39). Understanding the socio-culturally expected interactions set up by an initial
utterance allows interlocutors to anticipate specific lexical features, prepare their responses that
follow turn-by-turn, and know better how to recover from misunderstandings (Hall, 1995).

In order to develop IC, language learners must integrate a variety of skills. Young’s (2000) sixcomponent framework of IC includes: “rhetorical script…, specific register…, strategies for taking
turns…, management of topics…, patterns in interaction…, and signaling for boundaries” (Young,
2000, p. 8-10). Strategies for taking turns, topic management, and signaling for boundaries are
identify specific skills necessary for IC (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011).

The development of the above skills requires “(1) guided practice in those interactive practices
considered significant by and to the learners, and (2) the systematic study of L2 interactive practice,
including their conventional resources and typical meanings, their varied uses by the participants
of the practices and the consequences engendered by these uses” (Hall, 1999, p. 137). Learners must
notice the language that co-exists with a specific context and recognize that the context limits the
language choices that they may make. Specifically, teachers must guide learners to recognize
patterns of interaction. Items to analyze include “setting(s),… COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE
24 participants,… expected goals or outcomes of the activity,… topic(s),… constitutive speech acts
and their sequential development,… participation structures,… and the formulaic openings,
transitions, and closings (Hall, 1999, p. 146-148). Beginning language learners should focus on
more ritualized contexts, while more advanced learners can consideration variations found in less
ritualized contexts.

While linguistic proficiency and contextual awareness are necessary for communication to take
place, an internal motivation is also necessary: “successful communication is not just about shared
knowledge of linguistic cues but also, and perhaps more importantly, a shared willingness to
cooperate” (Hall, Hendricks, & Orr, 2004, p. 81). Language users draw an identity from their ability
to use language, with this identity affecting motivation for learning more language. While
interaction with more proficient language users can increase IC, the L2 speakers desiring growth
must feel welcome within the interaction. If the more proficient language users view themselves as
collaborators in the process alongside the L2 speakers, instead of the experts who have more power
than the L2 speakers, the L2 speakers’ motivation and sense of identity will be more likely to push
them to develop greater L2 proficiency (Hall et al., 2004). In the classroom, teachers need to be
intentional about building this collaborative dynamic wherein all students have valuable ideas to
offer to the class.

Teachers are likely to view students who employ greater classroom interaction as “active, creative,
and successful” (Hall & Walsh, 2002, p. 191) language users. Typically, teachers use an initiationresponse-evaluation (IRE) format of question and answer in the classroom. This process does not
lead students to extended interactions, however, and opportunities for language growth are lost. If
teachers change the third component evaluation to follow-up, thus an IRF format, the interaction is
extended and students have an opportunity to demonstrate their desire COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 25 to use the language (Hall & Walsh, 2002). As mentioned previously, language
learners need opportunities for interaction in order for their IC to grow.

Tools for Interactional Competence Learning and Assessment When focusing specifically on
developing IC of L2 speakers, conversation analysis (CA) can help to identify changes in L2
speakers’ language and interaction choices. “Foundational to CA is the idea that individuals in
talk-in-interaction are competent individuals who, in sharing social group membership, share
knowledge on which they draw in the accomplishment of their interactional activities” (Hall, 2009,
p. 2). CA, unconcerned with the correctness of language, identifies how interlocutors make use of
language and other resources in a given interaction and must be based on non-elicited speech
(Pekarek Doehler, 2013). “It has been suggested that the development of L2 IC can be understood
and studied in terms of a change in participants’ methods for accomplishing L2 talk-in-interaction”
(Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011, p. 7). An analysis of the changes an L2 speaker makes in a recurring
interactional task over time can reveal the acquisition of both language and socio-culturally
appropriate behaviors that has occurred (Hall & Pekarek Doehler, 2011).

L2 IC requires the acquisition of several context-specific conversation development strategies.
Interactional moves that L2 learners must acquire to competently participate in L1 interactions
include “turn-taking, opening or closing conversations, prefacing stories, proffering
disagreements,” (Pekarek Doehler, 2013, p. 150). Other aspects include “gaze and bodily contact,
systematic procedures,…precision timing and the sequential organization of actions and turns at
talk” (Pekarek Doehler, 2013, p. 150). CA allows a focus on L2 speakers’ appropriation of resources
rather than on comparison to native-speaker language, for “in the coordination of these resources
for all practical purposes…lies the L2 speaker’s interactionalCOMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE
26 competence” (Pekarek Doehler, 2013, p. 155). Furthermore, L2 speakers demonstrate IC through
discursive practices, “recurring episodes of social interaction in context…of social and cultural
significance to a community of speakers” such as “greeting, leave-taking, and picking up a child
from school” (Young, 2011, p. 427). By analyzing actual transcripts of what people say in order to
accomplish certain goals, teachers and L2 learners can identify what is necessary to achieve those
goals in terms of interaction and communication. Teachers can also identify areas where their L2
speakers need to continue to develop.

CA can lead adult language learners to be “better able to anticipate, interpret, and engage in
culturally recognizable practices through talk-in-interaction when using the target language” (Fujii,
2012, p. 102). Other benefits include “[helping] learners both to overcome certain psychological
barriers to language learning and also to notice a number of aspects of L2 interactions which
otherwise may have escaped them” (Fujii, 2012, p. 112). Language learners are sometimes
unwilling to mimic the culturally appropriate behavior that they notice. Although language
learners need to be aware of L2 pragmatics, they should not be compelled to assimilate into the L2
culture mindlessly. While teachers should expose language learners to L2 norms, L2 speakers must
have the choice of whether or not to use native speaker-like language forms (Fujii, 2012). Choosing
to appropriate a culture’s linguistic moves and behaviors is part of one’s identity, and the student,
himself or herself, should make his or her own identity decisions, not the teacher. When language
learners recognize how L2 norms impact how language is created and received, learners “develop a
critical awareness of language use and…are empowered to make choices about whether to
participate and, when doing so, how to use the resources in ways that will enhance the realization
of their own individual goals” (Hall, 1999, p. 150).


**Communicative Competence**

Hellermann (2007) stated that IC development is evident when looking at how a learner modifies
his or her interactions to these discursive practices in similar situations over time. Assessing IC,
therefore, should focus more on paired and group student interaction, rather than interaction solely
between teacher and student (May, 2009). With this in mind, IC assessment must look at the
interaction as a whole, rather than the IC of any one participant. In contrast to typical teacherstudent language proficiency interviews, “paired speaking tests have the potential to elicit features
of interactional competence, including a range of conversation management skills” (May, 2009, p.


**Lovely Professional University** **143**


_**Unit 13: Communicative Competence**_


415). Raters used to the traditional teacher-student interviews may find that the relational dynamic
between dyad members impacts how the participants respond in the interaction, and this dynamic
can cause raters great difficulty in determining how to assess fair individual scores.


**Examples of Interactional Competence Development**

If language learners have the opportunity to speak repeatedly with more experienced speakers in
similar contexts, these language learners will increase their IC (Masuda, 2011).

Masuda’s study reviews the acquisition of the interactional particle (IP) ne by Japanese as a Foreign
Language Learners in a study abroad program. This IP allows turn-taking in a conversation to
move forward, as ne is used in manners such as “displaying and seeking agreement or
confirmation, initiating interaction, introducing a new topic, and mitigating face threatening acts”
(Masuda, 2011, p. 521). Repeated interactions with a focus on ne lead some learners to move from
infrequent, and sometimes incorrect, use further along a continuum towards non-formulaic,
intentional use in conversations with native-speakers. However, language learners’ beliefs about
identity roles associated with a form (e.g. a male learner finding ne to be too effeminate) can
prevent the learner from developing IC with that form. Moreover, COMMUNICATIVE
COMPETENCE 28 language learners at lower proficiency levels are slower to build their IC due to
less ability to initiate and participate in conversations with native speakers (Masuda, 2011).

When considering L2 request approaches, some universal or cross-cultural trends tend to happen
with request interactions (Taleghani-Nikazm and Huth, 2010). According to CA, speakers receive
acceptance responses more often to offers than to requests. Therefore, a request might contain prerequest hedging, such as a question to raise the topic, a demonstration of the need for an acceptance
response, or an expression of preference. This attention to requests is part of the general CA
sequence organization concept, and L2 speakers with lower proficiency levels struggle more with
negotiating the sequences needed to make a request (Taleghemi-Nikazm & Huth, 2010). Sequence
organization, in relation with lexis and syntax, can be used to triangulate results to “show how
notions regarding the sociality, appropriateness, directness, or politeness of L2 learners’ talk
emerges from the data as collaborative achievements” (Taleghemi-Nikazm & Huth, 2010, p. 189).
Thus, sequence forms part of Hymes’ appropriateness component of CC in an interactional setting.

The discursive practice of writing conferences can lead a novice student to improve his language
through revision talk (Young & Miller, 2004). Through these writing conferences, not only does the
student increase his IC but the instructor does, as well. In Young and Miller’s (2004) study, the
instructor initially models the expected turns to be taken during the writing conference, but over
time the instructor learns which turns the student can take up. Eventually, the student takes up all
of the expected turns except those that solely belong to the instructor.


**Interactional Competence in Education at Different Age Levels**

Hall’s (1995) study indicates that foreign language classrooms provide little modeling of what these
interactions should look like and little opportunity for students to experience
extendedCOMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 29 talk interactions, such that students can learn how
to appropriately manage a topic in conversation in their new local cultural settings. L2 speakers
need both the modeling and the opportunity for interactional practice to succeed in interactions
with other speakers of the target language (Hall, 1995). In the following paragraphs, L2 IC growth
is discussed for a young child, for high school students, and for adults.

Cekaite (2007) addresses the IC that develops in a 7-year-old Kurdish girl in an immersion
classroom in Sweden, observing that the girl must learn “not only socialization to the cultural
norms of the target culture, but also socialization into the interactional norms and practices
appropriate to a specific classroom activity” (Cekaite, 2007, p. 46). Cekaite (2007) remarks that
“children need initially to acquire analytic representations of pragmatic knowledge, and more or
less fully develop them by school age, whereas adults may rely on universal pragmatic knowledge,
acquired through participation in a variety of communities of practice” (p. 47). Cekaite’s study
considers how the girl participates in multiparty conversational activities in the classroom setting.
At first, the girl is mostly silent and considered a compliant student.

Then, as the girl’s L2 proficiency improves, she demonstrates culturally inappropriate
behaviorbecause, while she has language to express herself, she does not understand how and
when to make her voice heard in the context of the classroom. By the end of the year, the girl’s IC
grows in parallel with her improved language proficiency, and she participates in culturally

appropriate ways both in response to others and through self-initiated speech acts. Cekaite’s (2007)
study demonstrates that linguistic proficiency grows at a different rate than IC, and both are
required for successful interaction in specific contexts. Teachers must not anticipate that linguistic
proficiency growth is predictive of IC growth, or vice-versa. Both must be monitored and
instructed in tandem but without a specific rate linked between them.

COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE

IC development in the classroom happens when students take part in “exchanges that are
spontaneous, topically coherent, and extend over multiple turns” (Todhunter, 2007, p. 605), which
can be difficult to do in a school setting. Instructional conversation in high school can provide a
natural interaction within the school setting where IC can be developed as students interactively
learn about curricular concepts. Providing a transition between formal instructionalactivities, this
conversation allows opportunities for authentic question and response between teachers and
students and for students to initiate target language conversations. When necessary, the teacher
can help students with necessary repairs in context and keep the conversation moving forward.
Furthermore, students can co-construct their understanding of the teacher’s target-language speech.
“Interactionally competent speakers negotiate meaning in order to repair communication
breakdowns. However, achieving mutual understanding does not always lead toresolution or
awareness of grammatical form” (Todhunter, 2007, p. 614). Instructional conversation allows
teachers to lead students to correct grammatical forms while the students also build their IC.

Hellermann’s (2007) study is concerned with the IC of beginning adult L2 English learners through
dyadic interactions. Students with lower English proficiency participate in little pre-task talking, as
opposed to students with higher English proficiency who spend some time in small talk before
beginning paired-work tasks assigned by the teacher. Furthermore, paired students will adopt
teacher-modeled language and peer language or mutually use available verbal and non-verbal
resources together as they attempt to prepare for and participate in teacher-assigned tasks
(Hellermann, 2007).

Using the concept of topic as her lens for understanding IC, König (2013) studies how how a
German-speaking au pair initiates conversations using self-selected topics during a year
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE 31stay with a French-speaking family. Over time, the au pair
increases her sensitivity in how to garner the other family members’ attention in order to address a
topic of her interest. Even though the au pair is an advanced French L2 speaker, her linguistic
structures do not improve significantly in the year-long study. Nevertheless, the manner in which
those linguistic structures are employed does show an increase of IC (König, 2013). At an adult
level, this also demonstrates the different rates of linguistic and IC growth.

Adult learners may “rely to some extent on their L1 interactional competence” as they interact in
the L2 (Barraja-Rohan, 2011, p. 485). L1 interactional skills and knowledge do not automatically
transfer to L2 IC. By using CA to identify IC features missing from students’ speech (e.g. response
tokens, assessments, and adjacency pairs), teacher-modified lessons can make adult students
explicitly aware of these items. These lessons can lead to student conversations which demonstrate
greater integration of the initial lacking IC skills (Barraja-Rohan, 2011).


**Summary**

Second and foreign language teachers must instruct much more than mere syntactic and lexical
structures because students in L2 language classes need to know how to interact effectively with
the L2 world around them, in schools, in the community, and at work.

Communicative competence and now interactional competence, along with their
associatedpedagogies, provide goals that teachers may strive to help their students attain. When an
L2 speaker can comprehend, respond to, and initiate interactions with native target language
speakers in ways in which the L2 speaker can understand the meaning, intent and cultural
expectations of the interactions, these goals will have been achieved.

**Objectives**


 - Studying different cross-cultural barriers

 - Ways to overcome those


**14.1** **Be open-minded**

First and foremost, you need to check your own attitude towards different cultures. You have to get
to know your employees, their backgrounds and origins, and find out a bit about how they do
business and how they communicate in their part of the world. For instance, “I’ll finish this soon”
can mean a lot of things in different countries, and if you don’t seem to understand each other
when it comes to certain phrases or ideas, don’t automatically blame it on the person’s laziness or
irresponsibility.

In other words, don’t be too rigid from the very beginning. If this different interpretation of
expressions or concepts doesn’t slow you down nor violates any rules, try being tolerant about it.

On the other hand, if it does go against certain procedures or disrupts the atmosphere, then you
have to be open about it. Show that you’re patient and understanding, but that there’s a line that
shouldn’t be crossed. Of course, you’ll have to understand these different cultures in order to
pinpoint the problem and solve it together with the employee in question.


**148** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_


Also, don’t go over the top with showing everyone how open and tolerant you are. In other words,
it’s very nice if you decided to learn some words in your employee’s language, but being too
obvious about it or shouting phrases in this language across the room all the time may be a bit
invasive and embarrassing for them. Sure, they might even like it, but you’ll have to be careful and
check if they’re happy about it or just uncomfortable. Don’t make a show out of it if they feel
awkward when you do it.


**14.2** **Efficient communication system**

If you expect your employees to overcome cultural barriers in communication, first you’ll have to
set them up with a reliable communication system. Without this, even the team members who
come from similar backgrounds will have trouble understanding each other.

First of all, you need a single centralized communication hub. A modern user utilizes a number of
different messaging apps and social networks to convey information, and this can create a lot of
confusion, especially given that people from different cultures prefer different channels for this
purpose. For example, users in the US or India usually choose WhatsApp, Chinese favor WeChat,
while Viber is most popular in Eastern Europe.

People who already need to deal with cultural barriers in business will get even more baffled if
their communication gets scattered across a dozen channels. Your employees can use these for their
private conversations, but when it comes to work they should be equipped with a centralized
system that will eliminate the noise and streamline the communication.

Brosix is a great solution in this respect, particularly for remote teams. You can use this single tool
for all types of communication         - texting, group chats, audio, video, file transfer, and even screen
sharing. It’s efficient, secure, and can be a great starting point for overcoming communication
barriers, both on a cultural and technical level.


**14.3** **Cultural difference awareness**

Next up, you’ll need to raise awareness among your employees about the effects of diversity in the
workplace and the importance of tolerance and understanding. This is truly vital as, for instance,
racial and ethnic minorities make up more than 30% of the US workforce.

You can organize different kinds of training for your workers for this purpose. If possible, try to
customize them as much as possible, based on the backgrounds and needs of the particular people
who work at your office. If you make it too general, there’s a danger it will be boring or
inapplicable, and it will seem like you did it only for the sake of protocol. This usually ends in a lot
of yawns and zero lessons learned.

Therefore, try to make this training as specific as possible and talk about concrete examples that are
related to concrete employees and concrete cultures they come from. Tell them about real-world
situations and how they should ideally behave and communicate. You can even let your employees
say a word or two about this if they wish to actively partake.

_**Unit 14: Cross-Cultural Communication**_


**14.4** **Let the new team members introduce themselves**


A great way for your team to get to know a new person in the office is to establish a practice of new
employees introducing themselves. Especially if they have a culturally different background.

Let them do it in an informal way, explaining who they are, where they come from, and what they
think is important about their lives, their characters, and their origins. Don’t make them only talk
about their work experience and how they’re very enthusiastic about getting an opportunity at
your company. This way, your team will have a chance to actually get familiar with this person,
and they may get an idea about how they should communicate with the new addition to the team.
The best thing is that it will all happen in a perfectly natural and spontaneous way.

However, don’t force this if the new person feels too uncomfortable about it. Give them time to
relax and show who they are, and trust your team they’ll be understanding enough not to do
anything that’s out of line until then.


**14.5** **Establish clear rules, but don’t rely exclusively on them**

The entire point of getting people to overcome cultural barriers is not to do it by imposing rules and
restrictions. Your task is not to police around looking for perpetrators, but rather to create an
environment where they’ll feel safe to express who they are without endangering anyone. They
shouldn’t be respecting and listening to each other because of a bunch of regulations you wrote
down, but because they understand their differences and fully accept each other in spite of them.

Still, this doesn’t mean having no rules at all. They should be your last resort, but sometimes you’ll
have to invoke them. Unfortunately, if all your other efforts fail, you have to have a well-defined
written code in place that will address concrete violations and measures that should be taken when
they happen.


**14.6** **Team building**


**150** **Lovely Professional University**


_**Notes**_
_**Advanced English Communication Skills**_

There’s hardly a better way for colleagues to develop understanding and get to really know each
other than out-of-work activities. Getting close and familiar with another person is the quickest
path to eliminating any prejudices about them.

You should be there as well, not to control them but to actually be a part of it. Broadening your
understanding of other people and cultures is a never-ending process for all of you.

This doesn’t have to be anything big or intense – you don’t have to go rafting, hiking, or bowling. A
simple drink or two after work will also do the trick. Let your team members casually familiarize
with each other and gain a better understanding of how all the others work and communicate.

This will help them a lot when they come back to their work activities. Remember, teamwork only
exists when people are able to smoothly and spontaneously understand each other and work as one
organism, instead of functioning only as a scattered bunch of individuals struggling to predict each
other’s intentions. For this, they’ll have to get to know each other as living human beings with
dreams, fears, hobbies, and ambitions. They’ll have to overcome perceiving one another merely as
job positions.

**14.7** **Seek feedback**

To improve any kind of communication in any area of life or business, being genuinely open is key.
Especially when it comes to cultural communication barriers in the workplace.

Simply put         - talk to people. Ask your employees for open feedback if they feel threatened or
misunderstood, or if they feel they can’t figure out someone’s ideas, actions, or behavior.
Sometimes people will feel left out or like they just don’t understand others, and they won’t do
anything about it because they feel uncomfortable talking about the issue.

This often happens when miscommunication stems from cultural barriers. It may be embarrassing
for an employee to admit that to other colleagues, and that’s why it’s sometimes difficult to
recognize that there’s a communication gap at all. It may seem like this person is just careless or
negligent.

So try asking your employees about this in an informal way. Don’t act like they’re guilty of
something, and make it clear that they won’t get anyone into trouble if they talk about this. Show
that you’re there to help them and the team be happier and more efficient. These
misunderstandings are often trivial, and they can be easily solved once they’re identified. It’s just
important to detect them and address them timely and properly.


**14.8** **Use simpler and more accurate language**

Sometimes, overcoming cultural communication barriers is about smart and careful people
management and building trust between your employees and yourself. And sometimes it’s simply
about being direct and using clear, straightforward, factual language.

Firstly, this means avoiding using slang that will not be understandable for some. Encourage other
team members not to use slang as well, at least when it’s about business and you need to be quick
and efficient.

However, using slang in a non-work environment can actually improve communication between
employees in the long run. Getting used to others’ use of language and certain phrases can
obviously help people understand each other. So it’s perfectly ok, even advisable, for your workers
to use a bit of jargon during lunch or coffee breaks.

But when it comes to work-related issues, they should probably keep this to the minimum.
Using accurate, factual language is very important, particularly in a culturally diverse workplace.
Don’t say “soon, ”          - say “in two hours.” Avoid using descriptive language when communicating
what you expect from an employee; instead, use numbers, metrics, and dates whenever possible.
This way, you leave less room for any kind of misinterpretation.

**14.9** **Utilize visual methods**


Humans are highly visual creatures, which is confirmed both by studies of human
evolution and studies of language. This is not a culture-specific fact, and that’s why it can be very
helpful in overcoming obstacles in communication.

It’s a lot more difficult to misunderstand visual language than verbal expressions. That is, if this
visual language is concrete and accurate. Graphs, charts, and diagrams are universal and easily
understandable, so you should definitely use them to your advantage.

There are many ways to explain or describe a chart, but essentially only one way to represent it
graphically. So, try encouraging the use of visual aids whenever possible, since it’s a great
foundation for explaining complex ideas and making important business points.


**14.10** **Stay composed in unpleasant situations**

It’s important to remember that even if you do everything right, you can’t control everything, and
communication gaps will occasionally happen no matter how hard you try to prevent them.
Cultural barriers have a lot to do with how people were raised and which ideas were imprinted on
them from a very early age. A couple of conversations and a cultural awareness training session
aren’t going to solve cultural misunderstandings for good.

Sometimes, the situation will even escalate out of proportion, and it may get quite uncomfortable.
Naturally, you should do everything to anticipate this and react before it happens. It’s much easier
to talk sense into people before any escalation, but, again, sometimes you just won’t have any
control over it.

Nevertheless, if this happens, you’ll have to stay composed and help de-escalate the situation. This
doesn’t mean pretending nothing has happened. That’s by far the worst thing you can do. Firstly,
it’s not going to solve the obvious problem, and secondly, your employees may completely lose
respect for you if they see you’re running away from important issues.

Try to solve things with conversation whenever it’s possible. Sometimes, what seems like bad blood
is only a temporary communication breakdown combined with impulsive temperament. However,
if it happens time after time, maybe it’s not a matter of miscommunication after all - and
sometimes, just sometimes, you’ll need to question someone’s benevolence and think about
whether this person belongs at your company at all.

specific sleeping patterns and wake-up methods can affect employees’ lifestyles and work
performance. All these can incite great confusion and give rise to unwanted tensions.

It’s very important to prevent or at least intelligently manage these potential disturbances. Namely,
more than two-thirds of job seekers have stated that a diverse workforce is an important factor in
evaluating job offers. In order to attract them, you’ll have to learn to tackle the problems we’ve
mentioned.

Moreover, remember that cultural differences go beyond differences in ethnicity and places of
origin. They can arise from class inequalities, generational gaps, or various personal backgrounds.
Two people that belong to different generations often have the same difficulties to understand each
other as two people from the opposite parts of the world. So what can you do to overcome cultural
communication barriers in the workplace?
