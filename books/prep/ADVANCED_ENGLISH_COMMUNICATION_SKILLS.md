## Unit 1: Reading Texts of Different Genres and of Varying Length

### Key Topics
- What a genre is and why it matters
- Major text types: Narrative, Recount, Procedure, Explanation, Report
- Fiction vs. Non-Fiction distinctions
- Subgenres within fiction: Folklore, Fairy tale, Fable, Myth, Legend, Tall tale
- Non-fiction types: Informational, Persuasive, Biography, Autobiography

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Genre:** A kind or category of writing defined by its arrangement and purpose (e.g., a recipe is arranged in steps, not paragraphs).
- **Narrative Text:** An imaginative story meant to entertain; encompasses fiction, fable, fairytale, myth, legend. Structured chronologically. Purpose: to amuse or entertain.
- **Recount Text:** Retells past experiences in chronological order to inform or entertain. No complication element (unlike narrative).
  - Generic structure: Orientation → Events → Re-orientation
  - Language features: Simple/past tenses, temporal conjunctions (then, before, after), action verbs.
- **Procedure Text:** Explains how to make or do something through a sequence of steps.
  - Generic structure: Goal → Materials/Ingredients → Steps
  - Language features: Imperative sentences, temporal conjunctions (first, second, finally), simple present tense, action verbs.
- **Explanation Text:** Explains how or why natural, social, or scientific phenomena occur.
  - Generic structure: General statement → Sequenced explanation
  - Language features: Present tense, formal language, headings/subheadings, diagrams with labels.
- **Report Text:** Presents information about something as it is, based on systematic observation and analysis. Uses timeless present tense, technical terms, general nouns (e.g., "hunting dogs" not "our dog").
  - Generic structure: General Classification → Description
- **Folklore:** Stories handed down through speech across generations (fairy tales, fables, myths, legends).
- **Fable:** Very short story with moral lessons, usually featuring talking animals.
- **Myth:** Story featuring gods/goddesses, explaining how something came into being.
- **Legend:** Exaggerated story about something that may have been real.

### Key Terminology

| Text Type | Purpose | Key Tense |
|---|---|---|
| Narrative | Entertain | Past |
| Recount | Retell past events | Past |
| Procedure | Instruct how to do/make | Present (imperatives) |
| Explanation | Explain how/why | Present |
| Report | Inform about facts | Timeless present |

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is a genre and how does it affect text structure?**
A genre is a type/category of writing defined by its arrangement to accomplish specific goals. Genre affects structure because arguments will have a thesis near the beginning with supporting premises; processes will have sequential phases; comparisons may alternate between subjects. Recognising genre helps readers anticipate structure and locate information efficiently.

**Q2: What are the three parts of the generic structure of a Recount Text?**
(1) Orientation — introduces who, what, where, when; (2) Events — describes what happened in chronological order; (3) Re-orientation — optional closing or conclusion.

**Q3: List three language features of Procedure Text.**
(i) Imperative/command sentences (e.g., "Wash the tomatoes"); (ii) Temporal conjunctions/adverbials of sequence (first, second, finally); (iii) Action verbs (boil, cut, mix) and simple present tense.

**Q4: How does Report Text differ from Explanation Text?**
Report Text presents facts and systematic descriptions of a class of things as they are (e.g., describing mammals in general). Explanation Text describes how or why a process or phenomenon occurs (e.g., how rain forms). Report uses timeless present; Explanation focuses on process/causation.

**Q5: What is the purpose of a Narrative Text and what are its common subtypes?**
Purpose: to entertain or amuse the reader with a story. Subtypes include: Fiction, Fairy tale, Fable, Myth, Legend, Tall tale, Folklore, Spoof, and Anecdote texts.

**Q6: What four benefits does reading a wide array of books provide?**
(i) Improves vocabulary; (ii) Develops a broader perspective; (iii) Improves reading and writing skills; (iv) Helps process information faster.

**Q7: Name and define three subgenres of Drama.**
(i) Comedy — has a happy ending; (ii) Tragedy — ends in sadness and death; (iii) An Elizabethan play — a specific historical category (e.g., Romeo and Juliet can be classified simultaneously as drama, tragedy, and Elizabethan play).

## Unit 2: Different Strategies of Reading Comprehension

### Key Topics
- Core formula: Facts + Assumptions = Conclusion
- The six main strategies of reading comprehension
- Tones of reading comprehension (16+ types)
- Role of keywords in reading passages and questions
- Thought Identifiers: Thought Extenders and Thought Reversals

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Tone:** The mindset/attitude of the author; what the author wants to convey. The tone of a passage greatly influences interpretation.
- **Key Formula:** FACTS + ASSUMPTIONS = CONCLUSION
- **Stated Arguments:** Explicitly written in the passage.
- **Unstated Arguments:** Hidden; include assumptions and inferences.
- **Keyword:** The word in a sentence that depicts or focuses on the main idea. Each sentence generally has one keyword. Examples: names, locations, years/dates, figures, capitalised titles.

**Six Strategies of Reading Comprehension:**
1. Tone of the passage
2. Keywords
3. Thought Identifiers
4. Skim and Scan
5. Understanding the main idea
6. Interpreting vocabulary words in context

**Major Tones:**

| Tone | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Narrative/Descriptive | Author narrates events or describes in detail |
| Jovial/Jocular | Humorous, cheerful |
| Sarcastic | Meaning opposite to literal words |
| Critical | Fault-finding or deep impartial analysis |
| Cynical | Doubtful, pessimistic |
| Nostalgic | Longing for the past |
| Acerbic/Caustic | Harsh, bitter expression of displeasure |
| Angry/Indignant | Outrage with justification |
| Apologetic | Expressing regret about past events |
| Condescending/Patronizing | Tone of superiority |
| Dogmatic | Assertive about one's own fixed beliefs |
| Euphemistic | Indirect, implicit expression to avoid offence |
| Grandiose | Elaborate, abstract, more than necessary |
| Introspective | Self-examination of feelings and actions |
| Incendiary/Provocative | Moving, soul-stirring; used by orators/politicians |
| Laudatory | Commendatory, praising |
| Pedestrian | Commonplace, uninteresting |
| Populist | Discusses characteristics of the general populace |
| Speculative | Theoretical, expert opinion-based |
| Belligerent/Bellicose | Aggressively combative |
| Biased | Favours one side |
| Commiserating | Sympathetic to suffering |

**Thought Identifiers (Conjunctions):**
- **Thought Extenders:** Extend the tone of the previous sentence. If the first part is positive, the next part is also positive (and vice versa). Words: and, so, because, due to, even, thus, furthermore, in addition to, therefore, hence, as well as, in the same way.
- **Thought Reversals:** Reverse the tone of the previous sentence. If the first part is positive, the next is negative. Words: but, yet, although, though, apparently, ironically, not even, but also, rather than, while, even though, despite, inspite of.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is the core formula for understanding a reading comprehension passage?**
FACTS + ASSUMPTIONS = CONCLUSION. Facts are stated truths; assumptions are unstated beliefs taken for granted; the conclusion is derived by combining them.

**Q2: Differentiate between Thought Extenders and Thought Reversals with two examples each.**
Thought Extenders maintain the tone: "She studied hard, and therefore she passed." (positive + positive). Thought Reversals change the tone: "She studied hard, but she failed." (positive → negative). Extenders: and, thus, therefore, hence. Reversals: but, although, despite, ironically.

**Q3: What is the difference between a Critical tone and a Cynical tone?**
A Critical tone involves fault-finding or deep impartial analysis. A Cynical tone reflects a doubtful, pessimistic attitude — the author is skeptical about whether something is worthwhile or will happen.

**Q4: Why are keywords important when reading a long comprehension passage?**
Keywords (names, dates, figures, capitalised words) serve as anchors. If you underline them while reading, you can quickly locate answers to specific questions without re-reading the entire passage, saving time.

**Q5: How many types of thought identifiers are there, and what are they?**
There are two types: (a) Thought Extenders — words that continue the tone of the previous clause; (b) Thought Reversals — words that reverse or contrast the tone of the previous clause.

**Q6: What is the difference between a Sarcastic tone and a Humorous tone?**
Humorous tone makes the passage funny and amusing in a cheerful way. Sarcastic tone conveys a meaning exactly opposite to the literal words and is often used for topics the author disapproves of; it is negative and mocking, not merely playful.

**Q7: What does the Nostalgic tone convey, and give an example?**
Nostalgic tone conveys longing for the past — it can relate to good or sad memories. Example: "I didn't go to the moon, I went much further — for time is the longest distance between two places."

## Unit 3: Reading and Interpreting Non-Linguistic Texts

### Key Topics
- Definition and meaning of non-linguistic communication
- Linguistic vs. non-linguistic aspects in translation
- Three non-linguistic quality aspects: Segment-level checks, Inconsistency, Numbering
- Five linguistic aspects in translation quality (SAE J2450)
- Tips for non-linguistic learning in education
- Role of visual context in language processing

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Non-linguistic:** An actual or possible derivation from a sentence not associated with signs that have any original or primary intent of communication. It captures different senses of "meaning" independent of linguistic uses.
- **Non-linguistic visual context:** Visual information that can influence language processing through referential and lexico-semantic links, even when irrelevant to the comprehension task.
- **Linguistics:** The scientific study of language form, meaning, and context.

**Three Non-Linguistic Aspects (Quality Checks in Translation):**
1. **Segment-level checks:** Ensuring no sentences or paragraphs are accidentally left untranslated.
2. **Inconsistency:** Ensuring the translation is consistent and meaningful throughout (source and target language).
3. **Numbering:** Checking numerical values, formatting, measurement unit conversion, digit-to-text conversion.

**Five Linguistic Aspects (SAE J2450):**
1. **Wrong terms:** Using incorrect terminology changes intended meaning.
2. **Syntactic errors:** Violations of grammatical rules (e.g., "I is going").
3. **Omission:** Missing words/letters can cause serious errors and costs.
4. **Misspelling:** Spelling mistakes reduce the quality and credibility of text.
5. **Punctuation mistakes:** Incorrect punctuation can completely change meaning (e.g., "A woman, without her, man is nothing" vs. "A woman without her man is nothing").

**Tips for Non-linguistic Learning:**
- Consistently use each type of non-linguistic representation (kinesthetic movement, pictures, graphic organizers, physical models).
- Encourage peer conversations to explain choice of non-linguistic representation.
- Use multiple non-linguistic representations simultaneously for deeper understanding.
- Encourage students to use these strategies independently over time.

**Why Reading Comprehension Matters in Non-Linguistic Subjects:**
- Encourages active, autonomous learning.
- Develops subject-specific vocabulary and discourse competence.
- Integrates new information with existing knowledge.
- Opens opportunities by improving overall communicative ability.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: Define non-linguistic meaning.**
A non-linguistic meaning is an actual or possible derivation from a sentence which is not associated with signs that have any original or primary intent of communication. It captures senses of "meaning" independently from linguistic uses (e.g., the predator-prey relationship carries intrinsic life-and-death meaning for all living organisms without words).

**Q2: What are the three non-linguistic aspects checked in translation quality?**
(1) Segment-level checks — no untranslated sentences; (2) Inconsistency — consistent and meaningful translation throughout; (3) Numbering — correct numerical values, units, and formats.

**Q3: How does punctuation affect meaning? Give an example.**
Punctuation fundamentally changes meaning. Example: "A woman without her man is nothing" can become "A woman, without her, man is nothing" — a completely opposite meaning — just by repositioning commas.

**Q4: How does visual context influence language processing?**
Visual context influences language processing through referential and lexico-semantic links. Even when visually irrelevant to a task, visual context can produce incremental effects on language comprehension, suggesting that non-linguistic visual context must encompass broad language-world relationships beyond reference or lexico-semantic associations.

**Q5: What is the difference between linguistic and non-linguistic communication?**
Linguistic communication uses a full language system (spoken or written) to convey messages; choices are wide and expressive. Non-linguistic communication uses gestures, facial expressions, signs, and body movements; choices are more limited but can be as powerful, especially across language barriers.

**Q6: Why is reading comprehension important for non-linguistic subject learning?**
It enables understanding of subject-specific vocabulary and conventions, integrates new non-linguistic information with existing knowledge, develops curiosity and self-evaluation skills, and builds the interpretive skills needed for non-verbal signs and symbols in technical subjects.

**Q7: What is the difference between omission and misspelling as linguistic errors?**
Omission is the accidental leaving out of a word, phrase, or even a letter, which can change meaning or incur reprinting costs (e.g., omitting "c" from "Barack"). Misspelling is incorrect spelling of a word; it reduces credibility and causes readers to lose faith in content quality.

## Unit 4: Reading and Understanding Incomplete Texts

### Key Topics
- Types of sentence completion questions: Single Blank, Double Blank, Cloze Test
- Approaches and strategies for sentence completion
- Role of context clues (hints) in identifying correct blanks
- Four broad tone categories used in sentence completion
- Keywords and Thought Identifiers in incomplete texts

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Sentence Completion:** Tests the skill to use information in complex/incomplete sentences to correctly fill blanks; assesses vocabulary power and logical reasoning.
- **Cloze Test:** A passage with blanks to be filled; assesses vocabulary, grammar, and logical reasoning skills. Also called "fill in the blanks" or "rapid fillers." It does NOT assess oratorical skills.
- **Single Blank:** One gap; solved by (1) defining the blank using context clues, then (2) matching the answer.
- **Double Blank:** Two gaps; both words must match — if one is wrong, eliminate the entire option.

**Key Strategies for Sentence Completion:**
1. **Hints:** The surrounding words indicate what should go in the blank. Test a hint by changing it — the blank answer must change accordingly.
2. **Pluses and Minuses:** Identify whether the blank requires a positive (+) or negative (−) word. Use this to eliminate options.
3. **Synonyms/Antonyms:** "Surprisingly" signals contrast (antonym expected); absence of such signals suggests continuation (synonym expected).
4. **Read the entire cloze passage first** to get the general idea before filling blanks.

**Four Broad Tone Categories (for completion):**
- a) Optimistic (positive)
- b) Pessimistic (negative)
- c) Neutral (neither positive nor negative — used for universal laws)
- d) Critical (can be positive or negative — positive = important; negative = serious/sensitive)

**Key Vocabulary Techniques:**
- In double-blank, you get two chances to eliminate each answer. If one word doesn't fit, the whole option is eliminated.
- Words like "surprisingly," "but," "despite" signal contrast → antonym expected.
- Words like "and," "similarly," "therefore" signal continuation → synonym expected.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What are the three types of incomplete text questions?**
(1) Single Blank — one gap in a sentence; (2) Double Blank — two gaps that must logically and thematically complement each other; (3) Cloze Test — a longer passage with multiple blanks to fill in.

**Q2: What does the Cloze Test assess, and what does it NOT assess?**
A Cloze Test assesses: vocabulary skills, grammar skills, and logical reasoning. It does NOT assess oratorical (public speaking) skills.

**Q3: How do you use "pluses and minuses" to solve sentence completions?**
Identify whether the context demands a positive meaning word (+) or a negative meaning word (−) for each blank. Eliminate any answer choice whose words do not match the required polarity. This helps narrow down options even if you don't know the exact vocabulary.

**Q4: Explain the two-step approach for solving a Single Blank question.**
Step 1 — Define the blank: use context clues in the sentence to determine what kind of word is needed. Step 2 — Match the answer: scan the answer choices for the word that best fits. Read the chosen word back into the sentence to confirm it makes sense.

**Q5: Why is double-blank completion "more forgiving" for weak vocabulary?**
Because you get two chances to eliminate each option. If either word in an answer choice clearly does not fit one of the blanks, you can eliminate the entire choice without needing to know the meaning of the other word.

**Q6: In the context of thought identifiers, what signals an antonym is needed in a blank?**
Words indicating thought reversals — such as "surprisingly," "but," "although," "despite," "ironically," "however" — signal a contrast, meaning the blank requires a word with an opposite meaning to what came before.

**Q7: What is the key evaluation principle when assessing your technique for incomplete texts?**
Evaluate using four principles: (i) determine what is to be evaluated; (ii) select techniques that match the purpose; (iii) target variety of techniques for comprehensive coverage; (iv) assess strengths and limitations of each technique used.

## Unit 5: Analysing a Topic for an Essay or Report

### Key Topics
- How to write a critical analysis essay
- Difference between descriptive and critical essays
- Steps of critical reading and critical writing
- Critical analysis outline and structure
- Techniques used in literary critique
- How to write an analysis report

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Critical Analysis Essay:** A critical evaluation of an argument, event, film, book, or social issue from multiple perspectives; includes personal viewpoint supported by evidence. It is subjective but must remain formal.
- **Descriptive Essay:** Simply states what, when, or how — it does not evaluate significance or viewpoint.
- **Critical Reading:** The initial step; involves identifying the author's thesis, rhetorical devices, biases, and assumptions. Considers: (i) intended audience; (ii) means of persuasion; (iii) structure and how it supports the argument.
- **Critical Writing:** Explores the work with the reader, opening up ignored aspects; presents a summary, analysis (interpretation and evaluation), and conclusion.

**Critical Analysis Essay Outline:**
1. Background Information (title, author, publication, statement of purpose)
2. Thesis Statement (your reaction/position)
3. Summary (demonstrate understanding without bias)
4. Critical Analysis: organisation of source, style and rhetoric, effectiveness, treatment of topic, appeal to audience
5. Conclusion (restate thesis, summarise reactions)

**Techniques in Literary Critique:**
- **Objective Analysis:** Evaluation based purely on facts; no emotion.
- **Traditional Critique:** Based on collectively agreed literary standards.
- **New Critique:** Focused on the text itself — irony, metaphor, ambiguity, paradox.
- **Marxist Criticism:** Through class conflict and political/social conclusions.
- **Metaphorical Critique:** Close attention to metaphors for deeper understanding.
- **New Historicism:** Literature studied through its historical value.
- **Psychological Critique:** Freudian analysis of author's unconscious wishes.
- **Sociological Criticism:** How literature represents or fits into society.
- **Moral/Ethical Criticism:** Judging a work by its moral lessons.

**Report Writing Key Points:**
- Reports are non-fiction accounts summarising facts about events or topics.
- Usually written in past tense; action steps may reference future.
- Should not introduce new topics in the final section.
- Must follow an outline to maintain direction and coherence.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is a critical analysis essay and how does it differ from a descriptive essay?**
A critical analysis essay evaluates the significance of a subject from multiple perspectives, includes personal viewpoint supported by evidence, and examines complexity and controversy. A descriptive essay simply describes what something is or when/how it happened, without evaluation or argument.

**Q2: What are the two steps to performing critical analysis?**
(1) Critical Reading — carefully reading sources to identify thesis, rhetorical devices, intended audience, biases, and means of persuasion. (2) Critical Writing — drafting the essay with a summary of the source, followed by interpretation and evaluation, and a conclusion.

**Q3: List five techniques used in literary critique.**
(i) Objective Analysis; (ii) Traditional Critique; (iii) New Critique; (iv) Marxist Criticism; (v) Psychological Critique. (Others include Metaphorical Critique, New Historicism, Sociological Criticism, Moral/Ethical Criticism.)

**Q4: What should a critical analysis essay outline contain?**
Background information (title, author, publication, purpose) → Thesis statement → Summary → Critical Analysis (organisation, style, rhetoric, effectiveness, topic treatment, audience appeal) → Conclusion (restate thesis, summarise reactions).

**Q5: What are three key things to consider when choosing a topic for a critical analysis?**
(i) The topic should lend itself easily to critical analysis (famous literature or controversial articles are ideal); (ii) The topic should be widely discussed so multiple opinions are available; (iii) Keep the topic narrow to avoid covering too broad a scope.

**Q6: What is Psychological Critique (Freudian Critique)?**
Psychological critique applies Freudian theory — the author's unconscious wishes, fears, and desires are read from the text much like dreams, providing a pathway into the author's psychological state and subconscious mind.

**Q7: What makes a good report?**
A good report (i) presents facts as a non-fiction, accurate account; (ii) is written in past tense; (iii) follows a clear outline; (iv) does not introduce new topics in the conclusion; (v) only reports what was actually done or found; and (vi) includes all information a reader unfamiliar with the subject needs to understand it.

## Unit 6: Editing the Draft and Preparing the Final Draft

### Key Topics
- Steps of the writing process: Pre-writing → Organising → Drafting → Revising and Editing → Final copy
- Differences between Revising, Editing, and Proofreading
- How to write a first draft (rough draft principles)
- Organisation and Cohesion in a research essay
- Style, Tone, and Word Choice in academic writing
- Citations and formatting (APA/MLA)

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Revising:** Making substantive changes — reordering paragraphs, deleting sections, rewriting entire sections. Content-level changes.
- **Editing:** Altering large sections of text; correcting typographical and grammatical errors; simplifying wording.
- **Proofreading:** Fixing grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors; checking for typos and flow after every draft and before submission.
- **Hook:** The opening device that grabs reader attention — can be: an anecdote, a quotation, a dramatic fact/statistic, onomatopoeia, or a false statement that makes you agree with the writer.
- **Organisation:** Argument flows logically from introduction to body to conclusion; each paragraph connects to the one before.
- **Cohesion:** Elements of the essay work together smoothly; source material is seamlessly integrated.
- **Style:** The sentence structures and word choices a writer makes.
- **Tone:** The attitude toward subject and audience conveyed through word choice.

**Writing Process Steps:**
1. Pre-writing (brainstorming, planning)
2. Organising (outline)
3. Drafting (rough draft — don't worry about perfection)
4. Revising and Editing
5. Final copy

**Checklist for Revising Organisation:**
- Does the introduction proceed clearly to the thesis?
- Does each body paragraph have a clear main idea related to the thesis?
- Do body paragraphs flow logically?
- Are topic sentences and transitions clear?
- Does the conclusion summarise main ideas and revisit the thesis?

**Style Checklist:**
- Avoid excessive wordiness; vary sentence length and structure.
- Avoid first-person pronouns (I, we) in academic writing.
- Use active voice; define specialised terms.
- Use clear, straightforward language; avoid unnecessary jargon.
- Maintain a balanced tone — neither too indecisive nor too forceful.

**Citation Standards:** APA (American Psychological Association) and MLA (Modern Language Association) are the two main standards. Every in-text citation needs a corresponding reference entry.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is the difference between revising and editing?**
Revising involves making substantive content-level changes: reordering paragraphs, deleting sections, rewriting to improve argument flow and cohesion. Editing involves correcting typographical and grammatical errors, simplifying wording, and clarifying meaning at the sentence level.

**Q2: What is a "hook" in writing? Give three examples.**
A hook is an opening device designed to grab the reader's attention. Examples: (i) a brief anecdote; (ii) a striking quotation; (iii) a dramatic fact or statistic; (iv) onomatopoeia; (v) a false statement that makes you agree with the writer.

**Q3: What is the difference between Organisation and Cohesion in a research essay?**
Organisation means the argument flows logically from one point to the next (introduction → body → conclusion). Cohesion means all elements of the essay work together smoothly — source material is seamlessly integrated with the writer's own ideas, and nothing is awkwardly placed.

**Q4: What are four style guidelines for academic writing?**
(i) Avoid excessive wordiness; (ii) Use varied sentence structures; (iii) Avoid first-person pronouns; (iv) Use active voice; (v) Avoid slang and unnecessary jargon; (vi) Define specialised terms; (vii) Maintain a balanced tone.

**Q5: What should the final edit of a research essay focus on?**
Two broad areas: (i) Errors in grammar, mechanics, usage, and spelling; (ii) Errors in citing and formatting sources (ensuring all in-text citations match reference entries, correct APA/MLA format, correct margins, font, spacing).

**Q6: Why is correct citation important in academic writing?**
(i) It gives proper credit to other people for their ideas and information; (ii) It positions the student's work within a larger academic community; (iii) It allows readers to locate the original source material; (iv) It avoids plagiarism.

**Q7: List the steps of the writing process in order.**
(1) Pre-writing; (2) Organising; (3) Drafting; (4) Revising and Editing; (5) Handing in the final copy.

## Unit 7: Re-Draft a Piece of Text with a Different Perspective

### Key Topics
- Concept and purpose of re-drafting
- Difference between re-drafting and proofreading
- Checklist for re-drafting
- Functional tips for re-writing
- Organisation, Cohesion, Style and Tone during re-drafting
- Four types of academic writing

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Re-Draft:** A stage in the continuous writing process involving shifting, rearranging, or deleting sentences/paragraphs, admitting fresh perspectives, and improving overall quality. It is NOT the same as proofreading.
- **Re-drafting involves:** deleting redundant elements; rearranging for better logic; incorporating new findings; revising with a fresh perspective.
- **Four types of Academic Writing:** Descriptive, Analytical, Critical, Persuasive. (Historical Fiction is NOT a type of academic writing.)

**Re-Draft Checklist:**
- Test of comprehensiveness — does the re-draft cover all necessary aspects?
- Ensure admittance of updated knowledge and new findings.
- Compliance with planned objectives and outcomes.

**Functional Tips for Re-Drafting:**
- Use forceful verbs by replacing long verb phrases with precise ones.
- Look for replacement words where words are used repeatedly.
- Offer sentence variety as much as possible.
- Never rely solely on Thesaurus — understand the words you use.

**Key Principle (same as Unit 6):** Organisation = logical flow; Cohesion = smooth integration; Style = language choices; Tone = attitude conveyed. All must remain consistent throughout the re-draft.

**Style Consistency Strategies:**
- Read the essay aloud to catch inconsistencies your eyes miss.
- Share with a trusted reader for honest feedback.
- Line-edit slowly, sentence by sentence; cover the rest with a ruler.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is re-drafting and how does it differ from proofreading?**
Re-drafting involves making substantive revisions — rearranging content, incorporating new perspectives, deleting redundant elements, and improving argument quality. Proofreading is limited to checking and correcting spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors on the surface level.

**Q2: What does a re-draft checklist typically include?**
(i) Test of comprehensiveness — ensures all needed aspects are covered; (ii) Admittance of updated knowledge — incorporates new findings; (iii) Compliance with planned objectives and outcomes. New findings should NOT be casually excluded.

**Q3: Name the four types of academic writing.**
(i) Descriptive; (ii) Analytical; (iii) Critical; (iv) Persuasive.

**Q4: Give three functional tips for improving a re-draft.**
(i) Replace long verb phrases with precise, forceful verbs; (ii) Replace repeated words with synonyms; (iii) Vary sentence structure to maintain reader interest; (iv) Avoid mechanical Thesaurus reliance — understand the meaning of replacement words.

**Q5: What is the role of a consistent style in re-drafting?**
Consistent style ensures that the essay reads as a unified whole; no word, phrase, or sentence should feel out of place. Inconsistent style confuses the reader and undermines the essay's authority. Strategies to maintain it: reading aloud, peer review, and slow line-by-line editing.

**Q6: How does re-drafting improve overall quality?**
Re-drafting allows the writer to: improve the logical flow of ideas; delete unnecessary or redundant content; incorporate fresh perspectives or new evidence; strengthen arguments; and ensure cohesion between all parts of the essay, resulting in a more polished and persuasive final product.

**Q7: What makes a research essay cohesive?**
A cohesive essay has elements that work together smoothly and naturally. Source material is seamlessly integrated with the writer's own ideas. Quotations and facts are introduced (never dropped in alone) and clearly serve the writer's arguments. Nothing is awkwardly placed or out of context.

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Summary:** A short account of a bigger work that provides a concise overview of the main points without the reader needing to read the original. A summary never uses idioms, metaphors, or complex language — it is always simple and straightforward.
- **Descriptive Summary:** Based on expression of facts; highlights the essential idea and crucial supporting information without the author's viewpoint. Used when the goal is to grasp and convey what the author said.
- **Evaluative Summary:** Contains personal opinions and assessment; evaluates usefulness, validity, argument strength. Used when critically assessing source material. May be longer than descriptive summaries.

**Pre-Drafting Questions (Framework):**
- What are the primary points in the passage?
- What is the passage about and what is its tone?
- What key details support the main ideas?
- What information is irrelevant?
- How would you write a headline for the passage in your own words?

**Tense Usage in Summaries:**
- **Present tense:** Use to describe an author's thought or argument that is still valid ("argues," "theorises," "fears").
- **Past tense:** Use to describe events or activities that took place in the text ("discovered," "conducted").

**Steps to Summarise a Passage:**
1. Read the passage once, then read it again slowly.
2. List key topics and keywords.
3. Summarise each section in one to two sentences.
4. Read your summary to ensure it matches the original's meaning.

**Tips for Effective Summary:**
- Find the main idea — identify the core theme.
- Keep it concise — typically 5–8 sentences; one-third of the original length.
- Write without preconception — no personal opinion.
- Maintain coherence — use transition words.
- Use verbs of summarisation: "argues," "theorises," "concludes," "states."

**Avoiding Plagiarism:**
- Write in your own words; avoid copy-pasting directly.
- Always cite direct quotes and specific data.
- Use in-text citations and full reference citations.
- Use verbs that signal summarisation to keep the author's ideas separate from your own.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is a summary and what should it never contain?**
A summary is a concise, short account of a bigger work conveying only the main points without detail. It should never contain: personal opinion (in a descriptive summary), idioms, metaphors, sayings, or complex language. It must always be written in simple, straightforward language, mostly in the writer's own words.

**Q2: What is the difference between a Descriptive and an Evaluative summary?**
A Descriptive summary presents facts and the essential idea of the original without the summariser's viewpoint. An Evaluative summary assesses the work — its usefulness, validity, and argument strength — and includes the summariser's personal opinions and evaluation.

**Q3: What is the general guideline for the length of a summary?**
A summary should generally be one-third of the length of the original passage. A summary paragraph is typically 5–8 sentences.

**Q4: When should present tense and past tense be used in a summary?**
Present tense is used to describe an author's thought or argument that is considered currently valid (e.g., "Weisenfeld argues…"). Past tense is used to describe an action or event that occurred in the text (e.g., "He discovered that…").

**Q5: How can a writer avoid plagiarism when writing a summary?**
(i) Write in your own words throughout; (ii) Put direct quotes within quotation marks and cite them; (iii) Use verbs of summarisation (argues, theorises, states) to show you are paraphrasing; (iv) Include both in-text and full reference citations; (v) Do not copy and paste data from the original.

**Q6: List four tips for writing an effective summary.**
(i) Find and focus on the main idea; (ii) Keep it concise — remove redundant text; (iii) Write without preconception — no personal opinions; (iv) Maintain coherence using transition words to connect ideas.

**Q7: What questions should you ask before drafting a summary?**
What is the passage about? What is the tone? What are the primary points? What key details support them? What information is irrelevant? How would you write a headline in your own words?

- Definition of idioms and common business/everyday idioms
- Punctuation marks and their correct usage
- Apostrophe (possession and contraction), hyphen, ellipsis
- Comma, colon, semicolon, exclamation mark, question mark, full stop

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Phrase:** A collection of words that function as one grammatical unit.
- **Idiom:** A phrase or statement whose meaning deviates from the literal meaning of its individual words.

**Types of Phrases:**

| Phrase Type | Head | Example |
|---|---|---|

| Adjective Phrase | Adjective | "smarter than me" |
| Adverb Phrase | Adverb | "during the show" |
| Prepositional Phrase | Preposition + noun | "under the tree" |

**Key Idioms and Meanings:**

| Idiom | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Back to square one | Start over again |
| Back to the drawing board | Return to the planning stage |
| Ballpark figure | A very rough, inexact estimate |
| By the book | According to rules/policy |
| Call it a day | Stop working for the day |
| Corner a market | Dominate a particular market |
| Cut corners | Take shortcuts |
| Diamond in the rough | Something with potential but needing work |
| Ahead of the pack | More successful than competition |
| At stake | At risk |
| Come up short | Fail to achieve a goal |
| Run out of | Exhaust the supply |
| Drop of a hat | Immediately, without hesitation |
| Play tricks on | Make someone victim of a joke |
| Look after | Take care of |
| Give someone a ring | Call someone |
| Add insult to injury | Make a bad situation worse |

**Punctuation Marks:**

- **Comma (,):** Separates items in a list, joins independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS), follows an introductory phrase, introduces a quotation, sets off interrupting phrases or direct address.
- **Colon (:):** Introduces a list, a noun/noun phrase, a quotation, or connects two related sentences where the second explains the first.
- **Semicolon (;):** Joins two independent clauses without a conjunction; separates items in a series that already contain commas.
- **Apostrophe ('):** Shows possession (singular: dog's; plural: dogs'); marks contractions (it's = it is). Avoid contractions in academic writing.
- **Hyphen (-):** Links compound nouns (mother-in-law), compound adjectives before a noun (four-year-old), and prefixes to words (re-write).
- **Ellipsis (...):** Indicates omitted text from a quotation; can also convey hesitancy, mood, or a trailing thought.
- **Exclamation Mark (!):** Indicates strong emotion (surprise, joy, anger); interjections; non-question sentences beginning with "what" or "how."
- **Question Mark (?):** Used at the end of direct questions.
- **Full Stop/Period (.):** Ends declarative or imperative sentences; follows initials (U.S.A.) and abbreviations.
- **Quotation Marks:** Single (' ') — for titles, specific names; Double (" ") — for direct speech and exact quotations.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is an idiom? Give three business idioms with their meanings.**
An idiom is a phrase whose meaning differs from the literal meanings of its individual words. Examples: (i) "By the book" — according to company policy/law; (ii) "Ballpark figure" — a rough estimate; (iii) "Corner a market" — to dominate a particular market.

**Q2: What are the five types of phrases? Give one example each.**
(i) Noun Phrase — "a striped zebra"; (ii) Verb Phrase — "was painting the fence"; (iii) Adjective Phrase — "smarter than me"; (iv) Adverb Phrase — "during the show"; (v) Prepositional Phrase — "under the tree."

**Q3: What is the difference between a colon and a semicolon?**
A colon (:) introduces additional information — a list, noun, quote, or an explanation of the preceding clause. A semicolon (;) joins two independent clauses that are closely related (without a conjunction), or separates complex items in a list that already contain commas.

**Q4: When is an apostrophe used? Give two examples for each use.**
(i) Possession — singular: "the Prince's role"; plural: "my parents' support"; (ii) Contraction — "it is" → "it's"; "he is" → "he's". Note: contractions should be avoided in academic/formal writing.

**Q5: What is a hyphen used for? Give three types of use with examples.**
(i) Compound nouns: mother-in-law, runner-up; (ii) Compound adjectives before a noun: air-tight seal, old-fashioned lady; (iii) Prefix to a word: re-write, ex-wife, pre-19th century.

**Q6: What does an ellipsis (...) indicate? Give two uses.**
(i) Omission: to indicate that words/phrases/paragraphs have been left out of a quotation (e.g., "…after hours of careful thought, we vetoed the bill."); (ii) Hesitancy or trailing thought: "I don't know … I'm not sure."

**Q7: What punctuation mark ends each of these? (a) A direct question; (b) An expression of strong emotion; (c) An indirect question.**
(a) Question mark (?); (b) Exclamation mark (!); (c) Full stop/Period (.) — e.g., "He asked me why I missed the concert."

## Unit 10: Introduction to Communication — Principles and Process

### Key Topics
- Definition of communication
- Five features of communication
- Types: Verbal (Written, Oral) and Non-Verbal communication
- Sub-types of Non-Verbal communication (Proxemics, Haptics, Artifacts, etc.)
- Formal vs. Informal communication; Downward, Upward, Horizontal flows
- One-way (Linear) vs. Two-way (Interactional) models
- Seven principles of effective communication
- Three contexts affecting communication

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Communication:** A process in which ideas, thoughts, information, and commands are shared; focuses on transmission and understanding with confirmation via feedback. (Keith Davis: "passing information and understanding from one person to another.")
- **Message:** An idea or piece of information the sender wants to share.
- **Encoding:** Converting thoughts into words using appropriate vocabulary for the receiver's level.
- **Channel:** The medium through which the message travels (spoken, written, electronic).
- **Decoding:** The receiver's analysis and comprehension of the message.
- **Feedback:** Confirmation from the receiver that the message was understood as intended.

**Features of Communication:**
A. Integral part of human life; B. Continuous process (birth to death); C. Two-way process; D. Rational/purposeful process; E. Requires sender and receiver.

**Types of Non-Verbal Communication:**
- **Proxemics:** Study of personal space — how close people feel comfortable with others entering their space.
- **Facial expressions:** Depicting feelings and emotions.
- **Paralinguistics:** Message conveyed through tone, pitch, inflection, volume.
- **Gestures:** Body signals (e.g., thumbs up).
- **Haptics:** Study of touch and its meaning.
- **Artifacts:** Accessories/clothing that convey personality.

**Formal Communication Flows:**
- **Downward:** From higher authority to subordinates (Principal → Vice-Principal → Teacher → Student).
- **Upward:** From subordinate to senior (Student → Teacher → VP → Principal).
- **Horizontal:** Between equals/peers (Manager A ↔ Manager B).

**Informal Communication:** Flexible, fewer rules. Major subtype: **Grapevine** — workplace gossip/rumour; spreads quickly; can be disruptive but keeps zeal alive if controlled.

**Communication Models:**
- **Linear (One-way):** Sender → Encodes → Channel → Receiver → Decodes. No feedback (e.g., TV news broadcast).
- **Interactional (Two-way):** Sender encodes → Channel → Receiver decodes → Receiver becomes sender → Feedback sent back. Used in most interpersonal communication.

**Three Contexts Affecting Communication:**
1. **Social Context:** Unwritten societal norms and rules; what is acceptable behaviour in a given group/community.
2. **Relational Context:** History between communicators; past conflicts or positive relationships affect tone.
3. **Cultural Context:** Race, gender, nationality, class, sexual orientation; marginalised cultures may be more guarded; intercultural communication requires sensitivity.

**Seven Principles of Effective Communication:**
1. **Attention:** Both speaker and listener must feel valued; listener provides appropriate feedback/cues.
2. **Clarity:** Speaker must be clear in mind before speaking; vague intentions lead to clumsy delivery.
3. **Timeliness:** Message delivered at the right time, for the right duration — not too long, not too brief.
4. **Completeness:** Message must contain all necessary information; no missing details or assumptions.
5. **Appropriateness:** Message must have rational relevance; avoid off-topic diversions.
6. **Feedback:** Receiver must respond to confirm understanding; resolves ambiguity for the sender.
7. **Correctness:** Information shared must be verified and accurate; avoid rumours and grapevine.
8. **Reasonability:** Both parties must accept different views; no forcing of opinions; persuade with logic.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: Define communication. Mention three key features.**
Communication is a process in which ideas, thoughts, information, and commands are shared, focusing on transmission and understanding with confirmation via feedback. Key features: (i) it is a continuous process; (ii) it is a two-way process; (iii) it is a rational, purposeful process.

**Q2: What is Grapevine communication and what are its effects?**
Grapevine is an informal communication pattern where rumours/gossip spread in an organisation without authentic verification. Effects: negative — can turn truth into lies, damage reputations, cause disruption; positive — keeps curiosity and zeal alive in a monotonous workplace if practised in a controlled manner.

**Q3: Distinguish between the Linear and Interactional models of communication.**
The Linear model is one-way (Sender → Channel → Receiver, no feedback), used in mass communication (e.g., TV news). The Interactional model is two-way (Sender → Receiver → Feedback back to Sender), used in most interpersonal communication, allowing mutual understanding to be confirmed.

**Q4: What is Proxemics? How does it relate to non-verbal communication?**
Proxemics is the study of personal space — the invisible boundary an individual maintains around their body. It is a form of non-verbal communication because how close or far one stands from another conveys comfort, relationship, and cultural norms without any words.

**Q5: What are the three contexts that affect the communication process?**
(i) Social Context — societal norms and unwritten rules about acceptable behaviour in groups; (ii) Relational Context — history and relationship between communicators (friendly vs. conflicted past); (iii) Cultural Context — race, gender, nationality, ethnicity, class — shapes sensitivity and expectations in communication.

**Q6: Explain the Principle of Completeness with an example.**
The Principle of Completeness states that all necessary information must be included in the message. Example: If you tell a client about profit-sharing conditions but omit loss-sharing terms (assuming they will "obviously" understand), the incomplete message can ruin a business deal.

**Q7: What is Haptics and give an example of how it functions as communication?**
Haptics is the language of touch. A single touch can convey a multitude of messages — a firm handshake conveys confidence, a pat on the back conveys encouragement, and a gentle touch on the arm conveys empathy or comfort, all without words.

## Unit 11: Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication

### Key Topics
- Detailed comparison of verbal vs. non-verbal communication
- Six elements of verbal communication: Tone, Pitch, Speed, Volume, Clarity, Pace
- Five types of verbal communication methods
- Advantages and disadvantages of verbal communication
- Three broad types of communication (Verbal, Non-Verbal, Visual)
- Role of non-verbal cues in authenticity and emotional expression

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Verbal Communication:** Transmission of information from one person to another orally through words and sounds; includes oral communication, written communication, and sign language.
- **Non-Verbal Communication:** How a message is communicated without oral communication — through body language, gestures, facial expressions, posture, space, touch.
- **Visual Communication:** Uses graphics, pictures, presentations, infographics to convey messages.

**Key Differences — Verbal vs. Non-Verbal:**

| Feature | Verbal | Non-Verbal |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery | Phone, email, face-to-face | Usually requires physical presence |
| Intentionality | Generally intentional | Often unintentional/subconscious |
| Grammar | Follows rules | More fluid, no fixed rules |
| Authenticity | Words can be controlled | Body language often reveals true feelings |
| Emotions | Useful but limited with children | Very effective across language barriers |

**Six Elements of Verbal Communication:**
1. **Tone:** Indicates the purpose — serious or humorous.
2. **Pitch:** High or low sound of voice.
3. **Speed:** Fast or slow speaking rate.
4. **Volume:** Loudness or quietness.
5. **Clarity:** How clearly words are pronounced.
6. **Pace:** Overall even or uneven tempo of speech.

**Five Methods/Types of Verbal Communication:**
1. Intrapersonal communication (self-talk)
2. Interpersonal communication (one-on-one)
3. Small group communication
4. Public communication
5. Mass communication

**Advantages of Verbal Communication:**
- Most convenient mode; conveys messages with clarity and precision.
- Most confidential medium; easier comprehension; instant feedback.

**Disadvantages of Verbal Communication:**
- No proof unless recorded; emotions can twist meaning.
- Can get lengthy; messages can be misinterpreted; irreversible — "words once spoken can't be taken back."

**Note on Non-Verbal:** "Actions speak louder than words" — the body can subconsciously deliver messages contrary to verbal statements. Non-verbal cues are especially powerful with children and across language barriers.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is verbal communication? How does it differ from non-verbal communication?**
Verbal communication is the transmission of information through words and sounds (oral, written, sign language). Non-verbal communication transmits messages without oral communication — through body language, gestures, facial expressions, posture, and touch. Verbal is mostly intentional and rule-governed; non-verbal is often subconscious and more fluid.

**Q2: List the six elements of verbal communication.**
(i) Tone — purpose indicator (serious/humorous); (ii) Pitch — high or low voice; (iii) Speed — fast or slow speaking; (iv) Volume — loud or quiet; (v) Clarity — how distinctly words are spoken; (vi) Pace — overall tempo of speech.

**Q3: What are the five types/methods of verbal communication?**
(i) Intrapersonal; (ii) Interpersonal; (iii) Small group; (iv) Public; (v) Mass communication.

**Q4: Why are non-verbal cues said to be more powerful than verbal communication?**
Non-verbal messages are often subconscious — the body can contradict verbal statements and reveal true feelings (nervousness, deception, genuine interest). The phrase "actions speak louder than words" reflects this. Non-verbal cues also work across language barriers and are especially powerful in communicating emotions to children.

**Q5: What are two advantages and two disadvantages of verbal communication?**
Advantages: (i) Most convenient and clear mode; (ii) Instant feedback possible. Disadvantages: (i) No permanent record unless recorded; (ii) Emotions can distort the intended meaning.

**Q6: What are the three broad types of communication?**
(i) Verbal Communication — uses words (spoken or written); (ii) Non-Verbal Communication — uses body language, gestures, posture, eye contact; (iii) Visual Communication — uses pictures, graphs, presentations, infographics.

**Q7: Give five examples of non-verbal communication cues.**
Eye contact, posture, facial expressions, touch (haptics), body movement/gestures, personal space (proxemics), and personal appearance/clothing (artifacts).

## Unit 12: Identifying and Overcoming Problems of Communication

### Key Topics
- Types of communication barriers: Attitudinal, Physiological, Physical, Environmental, System, Psychological
- Real-life scenario analysis of barriers (the "subway" case study)
- Strategies to overcome each type of barrier
- Futuristic media and their implications
- Casual listening as a barrier

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Attitudinal Barrier:** Prejudice or preconceived judgments about another person (e.g., assuming someone is ignoring you when they are actually deaf). Advice: Don't jump to conclusions; get more information before reacting.
- **Physiological Barrier:** Physical conditions (deafness, blindness, speech impairments) that hinder communication. Advice: Treat each interaction individually; don't categorise people.
- **Physical Barrier:** Literal physical obstacles (a veil covering lips prevents lip-reading; inability to reach a map). Advice: Consider how your physical choices or environment might inadvertently block communication.
- **Environmental Barrier:** Noise, poor acoustics, or location-based factors that prevent clear communication. Advice: Move to a quieter place; adjust the environment where possible.
- **System Barrier:** Technical failures (device out of power, transport delays). Advice: Check systems before starting the day; have backup plans.
- **Psychological Barrier:** Communication distorted due to human psychology problems — emotional state, stress, biases, anger, etc.
- **Casual Listening:** A problem where the listener is not fully committed — distracted, multitasking, taking no notes. This reduces communication effectiveness.

**Ways to Overcome Communication Barriers:**
- Attitudinal: Sensitise individuals, foster healthy work culture, build consensus.
- Physiological/Physical: Use non-verbal alternatives; adapt communication tools; modify systems for accessibility.
- Environmental: Keep a noise-free environment; proper use of AV framework; move to a quieter place.
- Cultural: Acknowledge cultural differences; sensitise individuals about diversity; use a lingua franca.
- Casual Listening: Encourage attentive listening; eliminate distractions; focus on one task.

**Futuristic Media (NOT a barrier):** Augmented reality, digital butlers, machine-to-machine communication. (Fax machines are NOT futuristic media.)

**Key Lesson from the Subway Scenario:** When one communication method fails, be flexible and try another. Acknowledge the effort when communication succeeds. Prejudice (attitudinal barrier) is often the first and most damaging barrier.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is an Attitudinal Barrier in communication? How can it be overcome?**
An attitudinal barrier arises from prejudice, preconceived notions, or personal bias about another person or group (e.g., assuming someone is rude when they are actually deaf). It is overcome by not jumping to conclusions, getting curious, seeking more information, and treating each interaction as its own separate incident.

**Q2: Differentiate between a Physical Barrier and an Environmental Barrier.**
A Physical Barrier is a tangible obstacle directly preventing communication (e.g., a veil covering lips prevents lip-reading; someone being too short to reach a display). An Environmental Barrier arises from the surrounding conditions (e.g., a noisy train passing by, poor acoustics). Both are overcome by adapting or modifying the conditions.

**Q3: What is a Psychological Barrier in communication?**
Psychological barriers are caused by human psychology problems — emotional state, stress, biases, anger, past trauma — that distort the communication. Unlike physical barriers, they are internal and often invisible. They cause miscommunication because the receiver or sender processes information through a distorted emotional lens.

**Q4: What is Casual Listening and how does it hinder communication?**
Casual Listening occurs when the listener is not fully committed — they are distracted, multitasking, taking no notes, or attention is not fully committed. This means the message is only partially received and retained, leading to misunderstandings, missed information, and poor communication outcomes.

**Q5: List four types of communication barriers from the subway scenario.**
(i) Attitudinal — assuming the other person was being rude/ignoring; (ii) Physiological — deafness of Woman #2; (iii) Physical — veil preventing lip-reading; (iv) Environmental — noise from the passing train disrupting the device; (v) System — device running out of power; (vi) System/Design — train leaving without them.

**Q6: What is the advice when a communication solution fails?**
Remain flexible and avoid disappointment. If one solution fails, another will come. Do not take failure personally or place blame on others. Maintain a positive attitude, acknowledge the effort made, and move on to find a new approach.

**Q7: Name three ways to overcome cultural differences in communication.**
(i) Acknowledge cultural differences rather than ignoring them; (ii) Sensitise individuals about cultural diversity through training; (iii) Build consensus on using a common lingua franca; (iv) Be mindful of emotional and historical backgrounds.

## Unit 13: Communicative Competence

### Key Topics
- Definition and origin of Communicative Competence (CC)
- Four components of Communicative Competence
- Chomsky vs. Hymes debate (Linguistic Competence vs. Communicative Competence)
- Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) and its value
- Role of pragmatics in CLT
- Interactional Competence (IC)
- Communicative Competence in multilinguals

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Communicative Competence (CC):** The ability to use language in a culturally appropriate manner to make meaning and accomplish social tasks with efficacy and fluency through extended interactions. Term coined by Dell Hymes (1972) in response to Chomsky's "linguistic competence."
- **Linguistic Competence (Chomsky, 1965):** Knowledge of the abstract rules of language (grammar) — separate from actual performance. Chomsky distinguished competence (knowledge) from performance (actual use).
- **Interactional Competence (IC):** Extension of CC; focuses on the ability to make appropriate language moves in real-time, turn-taking interactions within specific socio-cultural contexts.

**Four Components of Communicative Competence (Canale & Swain, 1980):**
1. **Grammatical Competence:** Knowledge of phonology, orthography, vocabulary, word formation, sentence formation.
2. **Sociolinguistic Competence:** Knowledge of socio-cultural rules of language use; ability to handle settings, topics, and communicative functions in different sociolinguistic contexts; using appropriate grammatical forms for different functions.
3. **Discourse Competence:** Mastery of producing and understanding texts across all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing); deals with cohesion and coherence.
4. **Strategic Competence:** Compensatory strategies when grammatical/sociolinguistic/discourse difficulties arise — using reference sources, paraphrase, clarification requests, gap fillers, coping with background noise.

**Key Scholars:**
- **Chomsky (1965):** Linguistic competence = knowledge of grammar; performance = actual use.
- **Dell Hymes (1972):** CC = ability to use language appropriately in social context (beyond grammar).
- **Canale and Swain (1980):** Defined CC's four components; grammatical + sociolinguistic features must both be in second-language courses.
- **Savignon (1991, 1997, 2002):** CC = ability to interact with other speakers to make meaning in authentic settings; CLT outperforms grammar-only approaches.
- **Pallotti (2010):** CC further divided into efficacy (reaching communicative goals) and fluency (achieving them smoothly and effortlessly).

**Communicative Language Teaching (CLT):**
- Prioritises meaning and authentic use over grammar drills.
- Students in CLT groups perform better on grammar assessments AND communicate more spontaneously than students in grammar-only instruction.
- Pragmatics is a key but under-used component of CLT.

**Role of Pragmatics:**
- Pragmatics = understanding the intent of communication embedded in specific cultural settings.
- L2 speakers must understand indirect commands, speech acts (thanking, apologising), and culturally implicit rules.
- Example: A parent saying "Where's the bread?" is an indirect command, not a genuine question.

**Multilinguals and CC:**
- L2 speakers develop CC in both L1 and L2; this is called **multicompetence**.
- The L1 influences the L2 (and vice versa — **bidirectional transfer**).
- Interlanguage: The in-between language system specific to a learner navigating between L1 and L2.
- Multilinguals generally have more varied communicative experiences than monolinguals.

### Exam Questions and Answers

**Q1: Who coined the term "Communicative Competence" and what does it mean?**
Dell Hymes coined the term in 1972. Communicative Competence is the ability to use language in a culturally appropriate manner to make meaning and accomplish social tasks with efficacy and fluency through extended interactions. It goes beyond grammatical knowledge to include socio-cultural appropriateness.

**Q2: What are the four components of Communicative Competence?**
(i) Grammatical Competence — knowledge of phonology, vocabulary, syntax; (ii) Sociolinguistic Competence — knowledge of socio-cultural rules of language use; (iii) Discourse Competence — mastery of text cohesion and coherence across all four language skills; (iv) Strategic Competence — compensatory strategies for communication difficulties.

**Q3: How did Hymes' concept of CC differ from Chomsky's linguistic competence?**
Chomsky's linguistic competence was about abstract knowledge of grammar rules, separate from actual use (performance). Hymes argued that grammar rules are incomplete without rules of use — CC includes knowing when and how to use language appropriately in social contexts, not just being grammatically correct.

**Q4: What is Interactional Competence (IC) and how does it differ from CC?**
IC extends CC by focusing on the ability to make appropriate language moves in real-time, extended turn-taking interactions, understanding the socio-cultural intent of other speakers and responding in kind. CC describes general language ability; IC focuses specifically on the dynamic, interactive process of real conversation.

**Q5: What is the role of pragmatics in language learning?**
Pragmatics is the understanding of meaning as embedded in specific cultural and situational contexts. It goes beyond grammar — learners must understand indirect commands, speech acts (thanking, refusing, apologising), and implicit cultural expectations. Without pragmatics, L2 speakers cannot achieve full CC in authentic settings.

**Q6: What is multicompetence in the context of bilingual language learners?**
Multicompetence is the ability of a multilingual speaker to manoeuvre effectively in two or more languages. An L2 learner's two languages influence each other bidirectionally. The L2 learner also develops an interlanguage — a specific interim language system — as they navigate between the two languages.

**Q7: Why is CLT considered more effective than grammar-only instruction?**
Savignon's research showed that CLT students perform better on grammar assessments AND communicate more spontaneously than grammar-only students. CLT creates opportunities for authentic language use, leading to more natural facility with language. Focusing on meaning while also drawing attention to form leads to full communicative competence.

## Unit 14: Cross-Cultural Communication

### Key Topics
- Definition and importance of cross-cultural communication
- Cultural barriers: language, habits, body language, work routines, time orientation
- Monochronic vs. Polychronic cultures
- Ten strategies for overcoming cross-cultural barriers in the workplace
- Importance of an efficient centralised communication system
- Use of visual methods and simpler language

### Important Definitions and Concepts

- **Cross-Cultural Communication:** Communication between people from different cultural backgrounds; affected by habits, body language, work routines, time orientation, and values.
- **Cultural Barriers:** Differences in language, body language, work habits, time perception, non-verbal cues, sleeping patterns, generational gaps, and class inequalities — all can lead to miscommunication.

**Monochronic vs. Polychronic Cultures:**

| Feature | Monochronic | Polychronic |
|---|---|---|
| Time orientation | Punctuality strictly observed; dislike being idle | Activity takes precedence over time |
| Scheduling | Optimum use through schedules and appointments | Frequent changes in plans; appointments not strictly adhered |
| Relationships | Task-focused | Invest time in building relationships |
| Leisure | Little leisure time (use time efficiently) | Plenty of leisure time available |

**Ten Strategies for Overcoming Cross-Cultural Barriers:**

1. **Be open-minded:** Check your attitude toward different cultures; don't assume laziness or irresponsibility for culturally different interpretations of phrases.
2. **Efficient communication system:** Use a single centralised communication hub (e.g., Brosix for remote teams) rather than many scattered apps.
3. **Cultural difference awareness:** Organise specific, customised cultural training for employees based on their actual backgrounds and needs.
4. **Let new members introduce themselves:** Allow informal, natural introductions so the team genuinely gets to know a new colleague's background and values.
5. **Establish clear rules (but don't rely exclusively on them):** Rules are a last resort; the goal is mutual understanding, not policing.
6. **Team building:** Out-of-work activities (even a simple drink) help colleagues get past prejudices and understand each other as human beings.
7. **Seek feedback:** Ask employees informally whether they feel misunderstood or left out; address cultural misunderstandings before they escalate.
8. **Use simpler and more accurate language:** Avoid slang in formal contexts; use numbers, metrics, and dates instead of vague terms like "soon." Direct language leaves less room for misinterpretation.
9. **Utilize visual methods:** Graphs, charts, and diagrams are culturally universal and harder to misunderstand than verbal expressions; use them to explain complex points.
10. **Stay composed in unpleasant situations:** Some cultural misunderstandings will escalate; remain composed, de-escalate through conversation, and don't pretend nothing happened.

**Cultural Barriers Beyond Language:**
- Racial and ethnic minorities make up over 30% of the US workforce.
- Cultural differences also arise from generational gaps and class inequalities — not just nationality or ethnicity.
- Two people from different generations can face the same communication difficulties as people from opposite sides of the world.

**Advantages of English as an International Language:**
- Wide, rich, cosmopolitan vocabulary.
- Largely phonetic compared to tone languages.

**Q1: What are the most common types of cultural barriers to communication?**
(i) Language barrier — different native languages; (ii) Body language differences — gestures have different meanings across cultures; (iii) Different work routines and habits; (iv) Different approaches to time (monochronic vs. polychronic); (v) Different values around relationships and hierarchy; (vi) Generational and class differences.

**Q2: Distinguish between Monochronic and Polychronic cultures.**
Monochronic cultures strictly observe punctuality, use time efficiently through schedules, dislike being idle, and have little leisure time. Polychronic cultures prioritise activity over strict timekeeping, frequently change plans, invest time in relationship building, and have more flexible appointment times.

**Q3: Why is it important to use simpler and more accurate language in cross-cultural communication?**
Vague terms like "soon" or "later" are interpreted very differently across cultures. Using precise language — numbers, metrics, and dates — eliminates room for misinterpretation. Slang should be minimised in formal cross-cultural settings since it is often culturally specific and incomprehensible to non-native speakers.

**Q4: What is the recommended approach when communication has been difficult but is finally achieved?**
Acknowledge the accomplishment. Taking a moment to recognise that the communication effort has achieved a desirable outcome helps form a more positive view of both communication and the other person involved. This builds goodwill and resilience in future interactions.

**Q5: Why should rules and regulations not be the primary tool for overcoming cross-cultural barriers?**
The goal of cross-cultural communication management is to create an environment of mutual understanding and acceptance — not compliance through fear of enforcement. People should listen to each other because they genuinely understand and accept their differences, not because regulations force them to. Rules should be a last resort for clear violations.

**Q6: How does seeking feedback help overcome cultural barriers?**
Cultural communication gaps often go unaddressed because employees find them embarrassing to raise. By proactively asking employees (informally) whether they feel misunderstood, managers can identify gaps early. Most cultural misunderstandings are trivial and easily solved once identified — the key is timely and appropriate detection.

**Q7: Why are visual methods effective in cross-cultural communication?**
Humans are highly visual, and this is not culture-specific. Graphs, charts, and diagrams are universally understood across cultures and languages, with far less room for misinterpretation compared to verbal or written expressions. Visual language is concrete and accurate, making it an excellent foundation for explaining complex ideas in diverse teams.
